<p>The history of the <span class="zean">a…ñasi</span> starts in another universe. <span class="zean">aj…õse…ñi</span> comes from the civilization called <span class="zean">aŒ∏…∂s</span>. Although we shall not delve into the specifics of <span class="zean">aŒ∏…∂s</span>, we shall reveal just enough to understand the history of <span class="zean">a…ñasi</span>.</p>
<section id="origin">
<h2>Origin<a class="headerlink" href="#origin" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p><span class="zean">aŒ∏…∂s</span> is a region of city-states with a culture oriented towards war and conquest. Each city-state is ruled by a noble family with the same name as the city. While a city changing its name is not an uncommon sight, many conquerers have been wed into a noble family to adopt the name of the conquered. And even then, the previous ruling family is ousted at best, killed at worst.</p>
<aside class="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-title"><span class="zean">aj…õse…ñi</span>‚Äôs Birth Date</p>
<p><span class="zean">aj…õse…ñi</span> exact birth date is not known, and even if it was, it would difficult to calculate when it falls in terms of <span class="zean">a…ñasi</span> time. Thus, <span class="zean">aj…õse…ñi</span> birthdate is celebrated as the day she landed on <span class="zean">a…ñasi</span>.</p>
</aside>
<p>We start with the birth of <span class="zean">aj…õse…ñi</span>. <span class="zean">aj…õse…ñi</span> is born of a woman named <span class="zean">√∞≈ìd…õ</span>. <span class="zean">√∞≈ìd…õ</span> was a noblewoman of a ruling family named <span class="zean">jy ãi</span>. <span class="zean">aj…õse…ñi</span> is born of wedlock to an unknown father. Nevertheless, <span class="zean">aj…õse…ñi</span> grows up as an heir to the family, and is trained in the art of war and politics. When <span class="zean">aj…õse…ñi</span> is the equivalent of 20 years of age, <span class="zean">aj…õse…ñi</span>‚Äôs home city is attacked by a warlord named <span class="zean">√∏Œ∏ysa  ãe Éj≈ì</span>. The city is razed to the ground and the <span class="zean">jy ãi</span> family is killed by the crazed warlord, but <span class="zean">aj…õse…ñi</span> and her mother <span class="zean">√∞≈ìd…õ</span> are spared. They are taken to the city <span class="zean"> ãe Éj≈ì</span>, the primary city of <span class="zean">√∏Œ∏ysa</span>. They are introduced to a <span class="zean"> ãe Éja</span> named <span class="zean">y ã…õ…πia</span> in <span class="zean">√∏Œ∏ysa</span>‚Äôs household. <span class="zean">y ã…õ…πia</span> has a daughter named <span class="zean">st…πai</span><a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#strais-father" id="id1" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>1<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> who is of the age to be sent to the <em>Academy Courtesan</em>.</p>
<p>While <span class="zean">√∏Œ∏ysa</span> had spared <span class="zean">√∞≈ìd…õ</span> so she could give birth to a potential heir to rule over <span class="zean">jy ãi</span>, <span class="zean">aj…õse…ñi</span> was a large liability as she would be considered an heir first. And yet <span class="zean">√∏Œ∏ysa</span> was stricken by the young and beautiful <span class="zean">aj…õse…ñi</span>. To counteract this dilemma, <span class="zean">√∏Œ∏ysa</span> sent <span class="zean">aj…õse…ñi</span> with <span class="zean">st…πai</span> to the famed <em>Academy</em> at <span class="zean"> ãe Éj≈ì</span> despite being older than the requisite age. Her status changed status as a <span class="zean"> ãe Éja</span> would invalidate her status as ruler of <span class="zean">jy ãi</span>, or at least make her hated enough that those in the city would not accept her as their ruler.</p>

<h2>The Academy Courtesan<a class="headerlink" href="#the-academy-courtesan" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>The <em>Academy Courtesan</em>, the crowning jewel of the city of <span class="zean"> ãe Éj≈ì</span>, was a school trained to produce the best of the worst, prostitutes. In <span class="zean"> ãe Éj≈ì</span>, much like other <span class="zean">aŒ∏…∂s</span> cities, prostitution was considered distasteful, all the while being extremely popular. Prostitutes did not receive much respect, yet the highly regulated profession had many restrictions on who could enter, and the best ones gained much fame.</p>

<p class="sd-card-text">There are two types of prostitutes: those who provide carnal pleasure as a service in exchange for money, and the trained <span class="zean"> ãe Éja</span>, graduated from the <em>Academy</em> to be the perfect companion. <span class="zean"> ãe Éja</span> are trained not only the art of giving (and properly receiving) pleasure, but also art, music and conversation. Trained <span class="zean"> ãe Éja</span> do not sell their service, but are leased (often permenantly or for a very long time) from the <em>Academy</em>. They can be sold, but only to temples as sacred prostitutes. Nevertheless, both a lowly prostitute and a <span class="zean"> ãe Éja</span> are considered equal in many regards and distasteful to the general populace.</p>
<p class="sd-card-text">See <a class="reference internal" href="../notes.html#on-levels-of-seniority-in-the-academy-courtesan"><span class="std std-ref">this section</span></a> for more information on the structure of <em>Academy</em> education.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The school education begins fairly early. Girls around 18 years of age begin their training in the arts, while being trained to relinquish any societal modesty. Novices are educated fairly well, learning to read and write, with a focus on poetry and art. After 2 years, they become Trainees who are trained in more sexual arts, as well as eloquent oration and rhetoric. After spending a year as a Trainee, girls fail and become normal prostitutes or remain a Trainee at their own expense (which is rare). At 18 years of age, Accepted spend a year training for a specialization in their artistic endeavor, and another year in observation of either lowly <em>Academy</em> prostitutes (the <em>Academy</em> maintains its own brothel), or temple prostitutes. Completing an examination of their skills allow them to become a <span class="zean"> ãe Éja</span>. Once a year, the services of old <span class="zean"> ãe Éja</span> are renewed or resold. In these same auctions, the new <span class="zean"> ãe Éja</span> are also commissioned to patrons or temples, but for these new <span class="zean"> ãe Éja</span> this auction is more important as not only their services, but their virginity are sold, occasionally separately, but it is not uncommon for a <span class="zean"> ãe Éja</span>‚Äôs virginity and services to go to two different people.</p>
<p>This is where <span class="zean">aj…õse…ñi</span> arrived. Upon entering the <em>Academy</em> most girls are given a Trainee mentor. <span class="zean">aj…õse…ñi</span> is paired with a Trainee mentor named <span class="zean">e…πa à…õ</span>, who is assigned with another Novice named <span class="zean">saeŒ∏a</span>. This period is especially difficult for <span class="zean">aj…õse…ñi</span>, since her strict, noble, and conservative upbringing makes it difficult to acclimate herself to the new climate. It wasn‚Äôt only <span class="zean">aj…õse…ñi</span> who encountered this difficulty, but so did <span class="zean">saeŒ∏a</span> who also had a fairly sheltered upbringing. The two were able to overcome this difficult together, shedding their anxiety with their sense of modesty, while retaining their confidence.</p>
<p>A little about <span class="zean">saeŒ∏a</span>: <span class="zean">saeŒ∏a</span> is the daughter of a prostitute, <span class="zean"> ãi Éetja</span>, who failed her Trainee examination at the <em>Academy</em>. Even so, <span class="zean"> ãi Éetja</span> had always been ashamed of her position and kept <span class="zean">saeŒ∏a</span> uninformed of her position in society until the day she was sent to the <em>Academy</em>. Because of her fairly sheltered upbringing by <span class="zean"> ãi Éetja</span>. Both <span class="zean">aj…õse…ñi</span> and <span class="zean">saeŒ∏a</span> were inseparable in the <em>Academy</em>.</p>
<p>As <span class="zean">aj…õse…ñi</span> moved on to becoming a Trainee, <span class="zean">st…πai</span> joined the <em>Academy</em> as a Novice, and was assigned to <span class="zean">aj…õse…ñi</span>. She is also the only Novice assigned to <span class="zean">aj…õse…ñi</span>. Since <span class="zean">st…πai</span> has been conditioned not only by her mother, but the other <span class="zean"> ãe Éja</span> in service of <span class="zean">√∏Œ∏ysa</span>, <span class="zean">st…πai</span> has a much easier time transitioning into the <em>Academy</em>. This allows <span class="zean">st…πai</span> to much better focus on her other aspects of her time as a Novice. With the help of <span class="zean">aj…õse…ñi</span>, she is able to excel as a Novice and becomes a Trainee a year earlier.</p>
<p>As <span class="zean">aj…õse…ñi</span> becomes an Accepted, <span class="zean">st…πai</span> is once again paired with <span class="zean">aj…õse…ñi</span> as a Trainee-Accepted pair. Although they had some mild moments as a Trainee mentor, <span class="zean">aj…õse…ñi</span> and <span class="zean">st…πai</span> were required to have plenty of intimate moments, and as such became very attached to each other. At the same time, she also maintained her friendship with <span class="zean">saeŒ∏a</span>. All the while <span class="zean">e…πa à…õ</span> becomes a full <span class="zean"> ãe Éja</span> and is bought by the Temple of the Primal Weaver. The Primal Weaver are a little known sect of forest-dwelling monks who follow the goddess known as the Primal Weaver. The recently growing sect of Primal Weavers had only gained enough followers to afford a <span class="zean"> ãe Éja</span>.</p>
<p>Throughout her time in the <em>Academy</em>, <span class="zean">aj…õse…ñi</span> stays aloof, maintaining her relationship with <span class="zean">e…πa à…õ</span> and <span class="zean">saeŒ∏a</span>, and later <span class="zean">st…πai</span>. But there is one who vehemently dislikes <span class="zean">aj…õse…ñi</span>: a girl of the same age as <span class="zean">aj…õse…ñi</span>, <span class="zean">y àa É√∏</span>. Competition was encouraged in the <em>Academy</em>. As such, different groups would form in the future <span class="zean"> ãe Éja</span> who would compete for privileges and attention, which was encouraged by mistresses and wardens. Despite <span class="zean">saeŒ∏a</span>‚Äôs insistence of playing this game of politics, <span class="zean">aj…õse…ñi</span> was never part of any schemes, and yet because of her natural intelligence and charisma was always able to thawrt any plan by anyone. <span class="zean">y àa É√∏</span> the leader of a gang of girls played a prank on <span class="zean">aj…õse…ñi</span> whereby she was humiliated in front of not only the other students but the Matron of the <em>Academy</em><a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#ayasedis-embarrassment" id="id2" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>2<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>. Although it wasn‚Äôt the humiliation in its entirety which cause so much anger to <span class="zean">saeŒ∏a</span> and <span class="zean">st…πai</span>, they decided to retaliate against <span class="zean">y àa É√∏</span> for this. <span class="zean">saeŒ∏a</span> and <span class="zean">st…πai</span>, along with some other girls, decided to tie up <span class="zean">y àa É√∏</span> and place her on the punishment stand, right outside the quarters of one of <span class="zean">y àa É√∏</span>‚Äôs favorite mistresses. As such, she was used by other Accepted, as well as some Trainee‚Äôs and even mistresses. This caused her intense humiliation, and from here seeds of hatred against <span class="zean">aj…õse…ñi</span> grew in <span class="zean">y àa É√∏</span>, despite <span class="zean">aj…õse…ñi</span> lack of involvement in this incident.</p>
<p>After this incident, <span class="zean">y àa É√∏</span> was always on a lookout to retaliate against <span class="zean">aj…õse…ñi</span> some way. One was by having <span class="zean">st…πai</span> fail her Trainee exam. <span class="zean">√∏Œ∏ysa</span> refused to have <span class="zean">st…πai</span> continue another year as a Trainee, and so <span class="zean">st…πai</span> was forced to become a prostitute at the <em>Academy</em> brothel. <span class="zean">aj…õse…ñi</span> and <span class="zean">saeŒ∏a</span> went on to become an Accepted. Occasionally, during this time, <span class="zean">aj…õse…ñi</span> is assigned to <span class="zean">st…πai</span> during her services, as is customary for second year Accepted. <span class="zean">aj…õse…ñi</span> and <span class="zean">st…πai</span> grow even closer, and although they had a close and physical relationship until now, this was when <span class="zean">aj…õse…ñi</span> and <span class="zean">st…πai</span> confessed about falling in love.</p>
<p>This is a cause for multiple problems. Besides the primary one that an Accepted cannot have sex with the prostitute she is observing, <span class="zean">aŒ∏…∂s</span> society has a complicated, but strict guidelines on homosexual tendencies. While sex between those of the same gender is allowed, and extra-marital sex between a nobles wife and his <span class="zean"> ãe Éja</span> mistress is considered fine, a non-carnal loving relationship between two people of the same sex is not allowed. This type of relationship is difficult to detect, and so this accusation is easily misused.</p>
<p>There were two people who knew of this secret. <span class="zean">saeŒ∏a</span> had known from the beginning as <span class="zean">aj…õse…ñi</span>‚Äôs confidant, and assured them that their secret was safe with her. On the other hand, <span class="zean">aj…õse…ñi</span>‚Äôs evil shadow suspected of this, but never had any evidence to introduce against <span class="zean">aj…õse…ñi</span>. And she did not dare accuse her of this as <span class="zean">aj…õse…ñi</span> was favored among the <em>Academy</em>. Thus <span class="zean">aj…õse…ñi</span> and <span class="zean">st…πai</span> continue their new relation in secrecy until the following year when <span class="zean">aj…õse…ñi</span> becomes a <span class="zean"> ãe Éja</span>.</p>

<p>At the auction, <span class="zean">aj…õse…ñi</span> is bought by <span class="zean">√∏Œ∏ysa</span>. This had been expected as <span class="zean">√∏Œ∏ysa</span> had been stricken by <span class="zean">aj…õse…ñi</span>‚Äôs beauty from her capture of <span class="zean">jy ãi</span>, and now that her succession to <span class="zean">jy ãi</span> had been invalidated, could safely keep her. <span class="zean">aj…õse…ñi</span> joined <span class="zean">√∏Œ∏ysa</span>‚Äôs household as part of the large entourage of concubines she already had. While most of <span class="zean">√∏Œ∏ysa</span>‚Äôs concubines were captured women, <span class="zean">aj…õse…ñi</span> joined the 3 <span class="zean"> ãe Éja</span> in <span class="zean">√∏Œ∏ysa</span>‚Äôs household. As <span class="zean">√∏Œ∏ysa</span>‚Äôs mistress, it was <span class="zean">aj…õse…ñi</span>‚Äôs duty to pleasure <span class="zean">√∏Œ∏ysa</span> in bed in any way she liked. She also occasionally entertained noble guests of <span class="zean">√∏Œ∏ysa</span>, but was strictly forbidden by <span class="zean">√∏Œ∏ysa</span> to become pregnant.</p>
<p>It must be noted that after leaving <span class="zean"> ãe Éj≈ì</span>, <span class="zean">√∏Œ∏ysa</span> spent several years in conquest. <span class="zean">√∏Œ∏ysa</span> used <span class="zean">aj…õse…ñi</span> very tactfully during this time. Among <span class="zean">√∏Œ∏ysa</span>‚Äôs entourage, and even her other <span class="zean"> ãe Éja</span>, <span class="zean">aj…õse…ñi</span> was easily <span class="zean">√∏Œ∏ysa</span>‚Äôs most favored <span class="zean"> ãe Éja</span>. <span class="zean">√∏Œ∏ysa</span> did not like to send <span class="zean">aj…õse…ñi</span> out to entertain her allies, but did use her when their allies were with her. <span class="zean">aj…õse…ñi</span> mostly participated in various group activities, and was reluctantly shared during this time. Thus <span class="zean">aj…õse…ñi</span> was fairly sheltered of many horrors her fellow <span class="zean"> ãe Éja</span> experienced when going out.</p>
<p>After 7 years <span class="zean">√∏Œ∏ysa</span> returned from her conquest to <span class="zean">jy ãi</span><a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#year-breakdown" id="id3" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>3<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> where <span class="zean">aj…õse…ñi</span> was reunited with her mother. The noblewoman had been installed as temporary ruler over <span class="zean">jy ãi</span>. <span class="zean">√∞≈ìd…õ</span> had worked for the 7 years to rebuild the razed <span class="zean">jy ãi</span> while entertaining and working with <span class="zean">√∏Œ∏ysa</span>‚Äôs allies. One such ally were the <span class="zean">say…πe É àe</span>, a warrior clan from an allied city nearby. With <span class="zean">aj…õse…ñi</span> removed from the <span class="zean">jy ãi</span> succession line being a <span class="zean"> ãe Éja</span>, <span class="zean">√∏Œ∏ysa</span> ordered <span class="zean">√∞≈ìd…õ</span> to have a child with the guest <span class="zean">…π≈ì É…πa say…πe É àe</span>. <span class="zean">√∞≈ìd…õ</span> bore a daughter, named <span class="zean">Œ∏is≈ì àe</span>, unbeknownst to <span class="zean">…π≈ì É…πa</span>. While <span class="zean">Œ∏is≈ì àe</span> would not inherit anything from <span class="zean">say…πe É àe</span>, her combined royal blood would make her eligible to rule over <span class="zean">jy ãi</span>.</p>
<p>Besides <span class="zean">Œ∏is≈ì àe</span>, <span class="zean">√∏Œ∏ysa</span> had in her household another child of <span class="zean">…π≈ì É…πa</span>, named <span class="zean">sai Ée àa</span>. Born of <span class="zean">…π≈ì É…πa</span> and his concubine <span class="zean">se àa</span>, <span class="zean">sai Ée àa</span> was raised to be a general for <span class="zean">…π≈ì É…πa</span> legitimate children. In being allied to <span class="zean">√∏Œ∏ysa</span>, <span class="zean">…π≈ì É…πa</span> had sent <span class="zean">sai Ée àa</span> as a gift to <span class="zean">√∏Œ∏ysa</span><a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#othysa-household" id="id4" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>4<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>. <span class="zean">√∏Œ∏ysa</span> did not care much for <span class="zean">sai Ée àa</span> and was assigned by <span class="zean">√∏Œ∏ysa</span> to guard her entourage, which included her <span class="zean"> ãe Éja</span> and other concubines. <span class="zean">sai Ée àa</span> resolved to accept this role.</p>
<p>The next 3 years, <span class="zean">√∏Œ∏ysa</span> would remain at <span class="zean">jy ãi</span>, ruling over the city through <span class="zean">√∞≈ìd…õ</span>. <span class="zean">√∏Œ∏ysa</span> gave the responsibility of raising <span class="zean">Œ∏is≈ì àe</span> to her entourage, and subsequently <span class="zean">aj…õse…ñi</span>. Although being an illegitimate half-sister, <span class="zean">aj…õse…ñi</span> and <span class="zean">sai Ée àa</span> were happy to take care of <span class="zean">Œ∏is≈ì àe</span>. During this time <span class="zean">Œ∏is≈ì àe</span> would grow to be 9 years old. But not all was well in these 3 years. <span class="zean">√∞≈ìd…õ</span> would see first hand how <span class="zean">√∏Œ∏ysa</span> would use her daughter. <span class="zean">√∞≈ìd…õ</span> and <span class="zean">aj…õse…ñi</span> daughter is complicated during this time. While overcome with love for her daughter, <span class="zean">√∞≈ìd…õ</span> is also disappointed by what her daughter has become, regardless of the fact that it was unintentional and forced. Over the 3 years, <span class="zean">√∞≈ìd…õ</span>‚Äôs disappointment is slowly replaced with a helpless anger against <span class="zean">√∏Œ∏ysa</span>.</p>
<p>Moreover, during these 3 years, <span class="zean">√∏Œ∏ysa</span>‚Äôs twisted nature showed to the fullest extent. She had a strange obsession with incest. She would frequently use <span class="zean">√∞≈ìd…õ</span> in bed, a prerogative she got as a conquerer and she liberally used. And immediately after, she would have <span class="zean">aj…õse…ñi</span>, <span class="zean">√∞≈ìd…õ</span>‚Äôs daughter, service her. Another way this obsession would come out was through <span class="zean">sai Ée àa</span>. Since <span class="zean">sai Ée àa</span> was half-sister of <span class="zean">Œ∏is≈ì àe</span> from her father‚Äôs side, and <span class="zean">aj…õse…ñi</span> was half-sister of <span class="zean">Œ∏is≈ì àe</span> from her mother‚Äôs side, in a way <span class="zean">sai Ée àa</span> and <span class="zean">aj…õse…ñi</span> would be considered sisters. <span class="zean">√∏Œ∏ysa</span> found enjoyment in forcing <span class="zean">aj…õse…ñi</span> to pleasure <span class="zean">sai Ée àa</span> in a relationship which was almost incestual, but not quite.</p>

Since there was nothing worth stealing from them, the group was mostly spared, but <span class="zean">aj…õse…ñi</span> and <span class="zean">sai Ée àa</span> were able to negotiate terms<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#deal-caveat" id="id8" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>8<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>, allowing them to travel with the gang. This managed to scare the Academy soldiers away, but also kept them safe from other more dangerous bandits.</p>
<p>Eventually, the group separates from the bandits at the outskirts of the Forest of the Primal Weaver. Some information on the Primal Weaver: the Cult of the Primal Weaver, as it was called in <span class="zean">aŒ∏…∂s</span> during that time, was well known, but not well considered. Most considered the followers of the Primal Weaver as dillusional, crazy, and savage. While the Cult of the Primal Weaver was relatively new, it was only new as an organization. Followers of the Primal Weaver had been living in the forest for centuries.</p>

<p class="sd-card-text">About the Cult of the Primal Weaver</p>
</div>
<div class="sd-card-body docutils">
<p class="sd-card-text">The cult was based on a goddess whose epithet was ‚ÄúThe Primal Weaver‚Äù, though among her oldest and closest followers, she was called <span class="zean">se…πikani</span>. To understand the cult of <span class="zean">se…πikani</span>, we must understand the goddess herself. She is a playful, but wise goddess, one who walks amongst the various primates in the forest she calls home. She is a masterful weaver, able to make beautiful tapestries from threads made from leaves, vines, and sometimes her own hair, colored using the various ingredients found in the jungle. Her followers believe the world to be a massive tapestry which the goddess is constantly weaving. Many of the cult members are proficient weavers themselves, whose works are highly sought after on the rest of the continent.</p>
<p class="sd-card-text">The majority of the Primal Weaver live in the middle of the forest in a small city named <span class="zean">a…πinka</span>. <span class="zean">a…πinka</span> was an engineering marvel. Although buildings in <span class="zean">a…πinka</span> were created from baked mud, wood, grass and leaves, these buildings were built without harming any trees. Built not on the ground but on the trees themselves, the trees were rarely cut into, but rather used as supports. Branches were guided into specific spots to support buildings, an excellent network of ladders and stairs would lead a person to the top of the city. An ingenious system of sewage and waterwork was used to provide for the people. The only buildings built on the ground were homes for the old, or the Temple of the Primal Weaver where <span class="zean">e…πa à…õ</span> and <span class="zean">saeŒ∏a</span> worked.</p>
<p class="sd-card-text">While many religious sects on <span class="zean">aŒ∏…∂s</span> provided <span class="zean"> ãe Éja</span> service in the temples, the Temple of the Primal Weaver was different. Large or rich temples in <span class="zean">aŒ∏…∂s</span> maintained one or more <span class="zean"> ãe Éja</span> in their temples for religious ceremonies, as well as some other prostitutes. Although temples discouraged extra marital sex, they provided outlets such as the <span class="zean"> ãe Éja</span> and the other sacred prostitutes to have religiously safe sex. While sex outside of a marriage was strictly forbidden, since these <span class="zean"> ãe Éja</span> were a religious servants, they could be used freely. Additionally, this service could be used to fund the temple. Another important distinction is that temple <span class="zean"> ãe Éja</span> were restricted to rich patrons and followers, while other prostitutes were provided for the rest of the followers. The Temple of the Primal Weaver only had <span class="zean"> ãe Éja</span>, and moreover, they were used not in a public manner, but as a role in religious ceremonies to the goddess.</p>
<p class="sd-card-text">The Primal Weaver is believed to be a rather promiscuous, curious goddess by nature. The followers of the Primal Weaver believed sex to be the most effective way to be closer to the goddess. Large festivals and celebrations contained a religious segment were such sex was encouraged. But most importantly, during religious events, monks of the Primal Weaver would engage in a sacred union to bring themselves closer to the goddess. Before the <span class="zean"> ãe Éja</span>, this duty was taken upon by one woman, who was rendered unmarried when she took upon the role. She was selected and anointed by the monks to become the vessel, and would be used as such until the goddess retired her. As the sect became larger, and <span class="zean">a…πinka</span> grew, the cult leaders sought to buy a <span class="zean"> ãe Éja</span> from the Academy to gain this duty. <span class="zean">e…πa à…õ</span> was the first of the Weaver‚Äôs formal sacred prostitute. <span class="zean">saeŒ∏a</span> would become the second. Only 2 such prostitutes were maintained.</p>
<p class="sd-card-text">Upon the introduction of the <span class="zean"> ãe Éja</span>, the role of the sacred prostitute was expanded upon. While sacred unions happened only during religious events, the common men were free to use the <span class="zean"> ãe Éja</span> during specific times of the day. Selected by lot, these common unions was a matter of pride for ordinary citizens and would be considered a special event for the common citizen. No transactions were made and both men and women were allowed. Most of these common unions were also held publicly, unless specifically requested by the sacred prostitute herself. The <span class="zean"> ãe Éja</span> in these vents (and in general) were treated with utmost respect, unlike their counterparts in the other temples. They were considered outlets of the Primal Weaver, second only to her in religious matters (sometimes above even the monks).</p>
<p class="sd-card-text">Because of their free views on sex, and their general ‚Äúsavage‚Äù ways in the eyes of the other <span class="zean">aŒ∏…∂s</span> religions and religious sects, the cult of the Primal Weaver is general considered dillusional, crazy, and savage.</p>

<p><span class="zean">aj…õse…ñi</span> has mentioned that some more time at <span class="zean">a…πinka</span> and she would have converted into a follower of <span class="zean">se…πikani</span>.</p>
</aside>
<p>When <span class="zean">aj…õse…ñi</span>, <span class="zean">sai Ée àa</span>, <span class="zean">Œ∏is≈ì àe</span>, and <span class="zean">st…πai</span> reached <span class="zean">a…πinka</span>, they were welcomed with open arms. The group was allowed to live in the temple with the other ordained <span class="zean"> ãe Éja</span>, and soon enough participated in the many rituals of the Primal Weaver. Here, we also mention that in her role as the sacred prostitute, <span class="zean">saeŒ∏a</span> had given birth to 3 children<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#cpw-view-on-pregnancies" id="id9" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>9<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>: the oldest, <span class="zean">seŒ∏i</span>, the middle, <span class="zean">a Éa√∞a</span>, and the youngest, <span class="zean">te Éi</span>.</p>
<p><span class="zean">seŒ∏i</span> was the 5 years old and <span class="zean">a Éa√∞a</span> had turned 3. <span class="zean">te Éi</span> was a newborn, <span class="zean">saeŒ∏a</span> having just given birth to him a little before <span class="zean">aj…õse…ñi</span>, <span class="zean">sai Ée àa</span>, <span class="zean">Œ∏is≈ì àe</span> and <span class="zean">st…πai</span> arrived.</p>
<p>The group spent about 3 years in <span class="zean">a…πinka</span>, where the details of their lives were mostly uneventful. There were three major events which are worth mentioning, the last of which initiates the beginning of <span class="zean">a…ñasi</span> as we know it.</p>
<p>Upon arriving in <span class="zean">a…πinka</span>, <span class="zean">sai Ée àa</span> falls in love with a young monk named <span class="zean">…ñi</span>. While they do not get married, in a few months in they conceive a child. Around a year in staying in <span class="zean">a…πinka</span>, <span class="zean">sai Ée àa</span> gives birth to, not one, but two children: twins named <span class="zean">dea</span> and <span class="zean">Œ∏ea</span>.</p>
<p>Around a year and a half after staying in <span class="zean">a…πinka</span>, <span class="zean">sai Ée àa</span> attempted to participate in the common union at the playful urges of <span class="zean">aj…õse…ñi</span>. Not expecting to be selected, <span class="zean">sai Ée àa</span> agreed. By random chance, <span class="zean">sai Ée àa</span> was selected, and to her embarrassment had to participate in the public event with <span class="zean">e…πa à…õ</span>. As a playful revenge, <span class="zean">sai Ée àa</span> arranged for <span class="zean">aj…õse…ñi</span> to be placed in the lots as well. And again by some miracle, <span class="zean">aj…õse…ñi</span> was selected as well. <span class="zean">aj…õse…ñi</span> slept with <span class="zean">saeŒ∏a</span>. The two <span class="zean"> ãe Éja</span> put on such a display that by the end the crowd was sweating in the cold month. The union was so powerful that the Primal Weaver herself made an appearance after decades, granting <span class="zean">saeŒ∏a</span> and <span class="zean">aj…õse…ñi</span> a sweet kiss on the forehead and the crowd a surprise audience before returning. Although such an event did not happen again, <span class="zean">aj…õse…ñi</span> was made an honorable monk, and made to perform the sacred union multiple times after that.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this had to end. Two years after first arriving in <span class="zean">a…πinka</span> (half a year after the audience by <span class="zean">se…πikani</span>) the succession war in <span class="zean"> ãe Éj≈ì</span> was over, and <span class="zean">y àa É√∏</span> had claimed the name of the city for herself. She got wind of <span class="zean">aj…õse…ñi</span>‚Äôs location and fabricated a reason to send a contingent of soldiers to <span class="zean">a…πinka</span>. The soldiers arrived in <span class="zean">a…πinka</span> and attempted to arrest <span class="zean">aj…õse…ñi</span>. The followers refused to give up the now sacred woman, and thus the soldiers attacked. In this ensueing panick <span class="zean">sai Ée àa</span>‚Äôs mate, <span class="zean">…ñi</span>, is killed. Once again finding themselves in the middle of a situation, <span class="zean">sai Ée àa</span> rushed <span class="zean">aj…õse…ñi</span> deeper into the forest. <span class="zean">saeŒ∏a</span> accompanied them to help, but they were surrounded by soldiers. In a desperate attempt, <span class="zean">saeŒ∏a</span> kissed <span class="zean">aj…õse…ñi</span>, calling <span class="zean">se…πikani</span>. <span class="zean">se…πikani</span> explained that she could eliminate the soldiers and even defeat the entire army <span class="zean">y àa É√∏</span> had sent, but even so, <span class="zean">aj…õse…ñi</span> would be placing many lives in danger. She explained that a better solution would be to disappear from <span class="zean">aŒ∏…∂s</span> completely, making <span class="zean">y àa É√∏</span> believe she was dead. <span class="zean">aj…õse…ñi</span> agreed, and <span class="zean">se…πikani</span> sent <span class="zean">aj…õse…ñi</span> to the planet she knew was habitable, and filled with goddesses who would accept the three.</p>

<p>As one expects, the gang did not do this for free.

<p>The view of the followers of the Primal Weaver on pregnancy, especially on the sacred prostitute, was very favorable. Many previous sacred prostitutes had been retired due to pregnancy, especially those conceived during a sacred union. Pregnancies during common unions was also possible and still accepted.</p>
<p><span class="zean">saeŒ∏a</span>‚Äôs 3 children were all conceived during a sacred union. Although it is difficult to ascertain who exactly the father is, based on appearance, the primary consensus is <span class="zean">seŒ∏i</span> and <span class="zean">a Éa√∞a</span> were fathered by the prime monk of the Primal Weaver, <span class="zean">≈ìl√∞ay</span>, while <span class="zean">te Éi</span> is fathered young monk, <span class="zean">≈ìl àas</span>. Unlike previous sacred prostitutes, <span class="zean">saeŒ∏a</span> was not permenantly retired upon her pregnancy, but took a furlough from her responsibilities, during which she was still provided for by the temple.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, <span class="zean">e…πa à…õ</span> was never able to give birth to a child, most likely due to some natural defect.</p>
