<h1>The Goddess Al-Manat<a class="headerlink" href="#the-goddess-al-manat" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p>The Goddess is the best warrioress in the desert. She is the desert. The desert is Her domain. She rides a beautiful Horse of Her sisters creation. Her clothes are made by Her. Her eyes are small but round with vertical slits for pupils with a very light shade of red. Her skin is a shade of sandy color. Her face is long and She has a small slightly upturned nose. Her ears are slightly pointed. She has a long, slim neck. Her breasts are large that are not affected by pregnancy. The nipples on Her breasts are inverted though when they pop out they have a sandy color. Her arms are muscular with 6 fingers on each hand: 4 fingers and 2 thumbs. Her vagina’s lips are perfectly tight that shows little of the penetration that happens in each ceremony. Her legs are longer than her body with toes like humans.</p>
<section id="her-clothing">
<h2>Her Clothing<a class="headerlink" href="#her-clothing" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>She covers Her face most of the time with a type of turban that has a long piece of cloth coming out of it which hides most of Her face except for Her eyes. The turban has a sandy color with a tinge of yellow. She wears a white bandeau with buckles on the side to tighten, loosen or take off Her bandeau. It is made of the softest material. Over the bandeau She wears a transparent midriff of a sandy shade. The midriff is sleeveless and covers the neck. On the sides of the midriff, near the armpits, there are two buckles to tighten, loosen or take off Her midriff. The Goddess prefers Her bandeau to be tight around Her breast and Her midriff to be loose.</p>
<p>She wears a white underwear with buckles on the side to tighten, loosen, or take off Her underwear. It is made of the softest material. Over the underwear, She wears transparent trousers of a sandy shade. On the sides, near the hips are two buckles to tighten, loosen, or take off Her trouser. Beneath the buckles, on both sides and at intervals of one foot are buttons. The Goddess prefers Her underwear to be tight around Her hips and Her trousers to be tight around Her hip and ankle and loose around Her leg joints.</p>
<p>On Her back are two scabbards on back holster for Her two scimitars. The scimitars have golden hilts inlaid with a ruby. On Her waist is a belly chain with a ruby hanging off the middle. On both Her wrists are golden bracelets. She also wears golden anklets on Her ankles. The transparent material she wears is so that it shows skin but you can see that she is wearing something. The Horse that She rides is also a beautiful sandy color.</p>
<p>This combination of transparent clothes and white underclothing makes the Goddess look naked from a distance. You would see the Goddess wearing only Her sword, bracelets, anklets and belly chain. A little closer and you will think that She is wearing sandy color bandeau and underwear. A little closer and you will see that She is wearing white bandeau and underwear over transparent midriff and pants.</p>
<p>Note: Before the Semination Day, the Goddess wore this in the Base without Her swords and with swords outside. After the Semination Day, the Goddess wears nothing on top in the Base and wears this outside.</p>
</section>
<section id="her-accompaniment">
<h2>Her Accompaniment<a class="headerlink" href="#her-accompaniment" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>The Goddess is accompanied by Her mate, Scarlett, and fifty women, all trained by Her in dual scimitars.</p>
<p>In the Base, each of the fifty women and Scarlett are required to go topless and wear their body chain. Outside each of the fifty women and Scarlett is required to cover their face. They wear the same clothing as the Goddess except underneath their midriff is a white bandeau that has an opening in the front to show cleavage. The opening is loosely sewed with a thin but strong thread in a criss-cross pattern. The sewing is tight enough to show a lot of cleavage but not their breast. The cloth is tight enough to show their nipples. Scarlett wears a gold body chain under her bandeau which rests in between her cleavage neatly. The fifty other women also wear a body chain made of silver. The body chain is tight enough to not look loose but loose enough to not leave an imprint in the skin.</p>
<p>They are not allowed to touch or talk to any man except in a formal duel or battle. They are required to show any women their breast and let them kiss it if they want as a sign of respect. No man can see the breasts or vagina of someone part of the Accompaniment. The Queen can have anyone of the Accompaniment, except for Scarlett, to have sex with her or any other woman or women of choice for her entertainment. She cannot order someone of the Accompaniment to have sex with a man or men. Any one of the Accompaniment cannot have sex with any man or men, even if they wish or not.</p>
<p>After the Semination Day, each of the Accompaniment are given a glass dildo designed after the penis of Scarlett and an ass plug of Scarlett’s design. They cannot put in Scarlett’s penis inside them. The most they can do is suck her penis or help her masturbate if her hands are busy. There is another dildo in the sex room that is double sided for two people and another that is designed to be put in the vagina and the ass at the same time.</p>
