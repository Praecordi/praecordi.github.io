Dress 
======

Royal Dress
-----------

This dress is used in many formal events though usually political. The dress is a version of a local dress including a midriff and a skirt. The local version of the dress though doesn’t expose the midriff. The Goddess Sotryphaena has combined the various cultures of different Goddesses, like Ma’ Sekhis and Dea, and hers. The Goddess Dea also practices clothing that is only one cloth and is meticulously wrapped and spread around the body to cover important parts. Ma’ Sekhis practices the use of rich jewelry and also monument building.

The dress of Sotryphaena is a very complicated dress that doesn’t need a top if worn properly. It is a long cloth that is usually a red and sandy color. Shorts are usually worn by the Goddess underneath the dress. But no midriff is worn. A servant is also needed to help with the dress since one slight mistake with the wrappings could lead to a lot of things revealed. The process starts with the long cloth wrapped around the waist twice. The cloth is wide enough to reach the floor. The cloth is not tucked into anything. Rather the remaining cloth is taken to the back and then brought over the right shoulder. In this case the cloth is folded because the extra width is not needed. The cloth is carefully spread out over the breast and then is wrapped under the armpit and around the chest. It goes over the left breast and reveals just a bit cleavage. It is wrapped around twice and then tucked into the wrappings around the chest. The dress follows the rule of baring the midriff. Underneath the Goddess usually wears sandals. The arms are bare. On the head a Goddess usually wears a headband over her long hair.

Battle Armor

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

The armor of the Goddess Sotryphaena is similar in style to the Goddess Ma’ Sekhis, the Goddess Thea and the Goddess Dea. The helmet is just like Goddess Dea. It is a gold colored helmet where metal comes out to cover the cheeks while a small protrusion protrudes out between the eyes all the way to the end of the nose. A red plume comes out of the helmet from the top. The chestplate is one of the Goddess’ own design, although not much different from any other chestplate. The Goddess wears a midriff underneath the chestplate. This midriff is red and has a wide neckline so that that it exposes the shoulders. The midriff also has a long sleeve. Over that, the chestplate has a golden color to it and, unlike the Goddess Ma’ Sekhis, the chestplate isn’t an exact mold of the body. Like the Goddess Thea, the chestplate doesn’t have a part that goes over the shoulder and is supported by the mere tightness. The chestplate of the Goddess Sotryphaena is strangely flat. There are no pauldrons, instead the rerebrace on the arm extend up just a bit to cover the shoulder. The vambrace is long and slim. On the hands, the Goddess wears sandy colored gloves. The bottom is somewhat similar to the Goddess Ma’ Sekhis. There is no belt but instead the same armor belt of the Goddess Ma’ Sekhis. Unlike the Goddess Ma’ Sekhis, underneath this armor plate the Goddess wears hard, boiled leather pants. Over these pants are greaves. The shoes are made of leather with hard soles. On the back, there is an attachable cape that can be attached to the rerebrace.
