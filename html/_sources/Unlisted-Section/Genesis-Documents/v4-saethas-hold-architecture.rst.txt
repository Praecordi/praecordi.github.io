Saetha’s Hold Architecture

Ashadha’s Architecture
======================

Ashadha’s domain contains settlements though they are extremely spreadout and small. Many of the settlements are small have a wide distance between them. Just like Teshi’s domain, Ashadha’s people use Jhiushes for short distance traveling while endoatmosphereic for longer distances. The material used for the building is hardened brick, while enhanced bricks are for larger structures. Metal is most commonly used for support. Buildings are large and made to house extended families.

Similar to Teshi’s domain, there are 8 major cities carefully spread across the planet. Each settlement is planned like every other planet’s settlements. There are 3 types of permanent settlements: the city, a town, and a residential.

The residential is the smallest type of settlement and contains large houses to house extended families. On average, one residential has 20 houses. Hangars and stables are integrated into each house so that public hangars are not needed.

The town is the settlement where most businesses are located. The town is usually surrounded by residentials in short distances. The towns themselves are located near the source of raw material. Each town is planned with a sewer system. Each town is given domain over a specific number of wells and oasis from which the town and the surrounding residents can get their water. Each town is protective of the water they get, and fights for water are frequent between towns. To protect themselves in fights, each towns also wall their most important buildings. Towns are led by a monarchial administration. Each town has a public endoatmospheric hangar to travel to the cities.

The cities in Thesgas are some of the smallest cities. Ashadha Herself does not have much of a taste for grandeur. Each city, including the capital, contains 5 fortresses that surround the palace where the administration of the city lives. An underground area is dedicated to farming. The city contains one exoatmospheric hangar at the center inside the palace. Endoatmospheric hangars are scattered outside the city. The city has a working sewer and water system. Each city only has a few necessary buildings alongside the only market in the whole planet. Mansions are not allowed inside cities. The only housing inside the city is housing for a standing army. The most important part of the city is the barracks that each city houses. Each barack is larger than any mansion and trains many of the best warriors in the whole system. The barracks are funded by the city itself. The capital city also houses one of the only and most marvelous museums in the whole system. The palace in the capital city is the largest palace though most of it is underground. The palace in the capital city is also the most sustainable palace in case of a siege in the whole system.

Soti’s Architecture
===================

The architecture in Soti’s realm is a combination of those of different domains. She adopts the style of Zoedashi Dea and Zoedashi Thea with the cemented structures and strong stone buildings. Though artistically she adopts many aspects from Sethi's realm, such as the grand size of monuments. Public buildings are given a lot of importance, but unlike Zoedashi Dea and Thea’s domain, public buildings are divided for the two genders. Religion is given a lot of importance. The Zoedashi Herself is loved across her realm.

There are 7 major cities in Chesghui. All cities are planned. The settlements in the Zoedashi's domain are divided into 3 types of settlements: city, town, and villae.

As mansions are not allowed in the cities, villaes are dedicated to housing the rich. There is no governance. Each mansion is made to house the extended family of the owner of the house, who is usually the head. Villaes are built with sewer systems and a water system. Most mansions have their own endoatmosphereic hangar. Each villae will also have a temple dedicated to their patron god which can be any from the Adasi pantheon. Villae’s are the center of activity in Soti’s domain.

Towns are specifically built for the purpose of housing large factories and work places. Each town is built by one merchant by obtaining permission from the city administration whose area they want to build it in. A town contains no residential housing. There is usually a public endoatmosphereic hangar for the convenience of workers. String laws limit the work day and require the maintenance of the cleanliness of the outer district. Towns are usually built around a villae most likely where the owner lives.

The city is the largest settlement. Each city is the center of trade and also housing, mainly for those who cannot afford to live in a mansion. The city consists of a large palace surrounded by a sector of temples and public buildings in turn surrounded by marketplaces for trade in turn surrounded by a sprawl of houses. Each city has a highly functional sewer and water system. The Zoedashi Soti also has one of the most strongest police forces and the capital city is one of the safest. The palace itself has an exoatmosphereic hangar while endoatmosphereic hangars are scattered throughout the city. The most impressive sight is the large amphitheaters built in the honor of the gods of the Adasi pantheon. The sector outside of the palace contains the amphitheater alongside with a pantheon of temples dedicated to the all the major gods of the Adasi pantheon.

Sethi’s Architecture
====================

The architecture in Sethi's domain is one of the most complicated in all of Adasi. The building in Sethi's domain involves a lot of stone and sculpturing with little to no cement. Metal is used as support in almost all buildings. Colors and gold are used abundantly. Most Pallakidans in Sethi's domain maintain a sedentary life. These Pallakidans are expert builders and designers and competent engineers. The old as well as the brave and courageous are highly respected so that many monuments can be seen dedicated to them. Sethi Herself is very highly respected and loved among her people.

There are 15 cities in Sethi's domain. All of the cities are planned and are extremely large. There are only 2 types of settlements: the city and the outer district.

The outer district are separate settlements that are specifically built to house the large factories to keep away from the people. Each outer district is assigned to one merchant for him to use. No outer district is allowed to keep any kind of residential housing except for the owner himself. The outer district contains a public endoatmospheric hangar for the convenience of the workers. Strict laws limit the work day and require the maintenance of the cleanliness of the outer districts. The administration of the outer district is the owner of the district himself although all the owners are bound by some laws that they must follow.

The cities in Sethi's domain is one of the largest settlements in the whole Adasi. Each city is built as a residential settlement for all the people on the moon. The city consists of a large palace surrounded by the mansions of those capable of buying them. Houses get more affordable and smaller the farther they get from the palace. Each city has a highly functional sewer and water systems. An exoatmospheric hangar is located inside the palace, while endoatmospheric hangars dot the whole city. There is no standing army during peacetime but during war the city requests citizen to house it’s army. The capital city is one of the grandest cities in Adasi. The palace dominates the city. The palace is large sprawling sculpture of the Zoedashi Sethi laying down naked. The chamber of Sethi is located right at the crotch of the palace. The Zoedashi also houses a large number of concubines which are housed in suites at the top the mountain like breasts of the Zoedashi's likeness. Most expensive mansions are commissioned to be built as a likeness of the patron of their house. Because of the strange culture of Sethi, most markets where foreign goods arrive are located farther away from the palace, and other mansions.
