The Khatas are seven of the High Empressâ€™s accomplices that helped the creation of Pallakidas. They are the same race as the High Empress and have some special privileges similar to that of the High Empress. One of the special privileges they share with the High Empress is using Elit fluid for pleasure. They also have the privilege to be dominant while engaging in sex with the High Empress.

Uniform
-------

One of the requirements that constrains the Khatas is the requirement to wear a uniform in any formal event, martial event or battle.

They have to wear a ferronniere; the jewel states that they are the Khatas. On top, they wear a white sleeveless midriff that has a vertical opening in the front showing their cleavage. The midriff is made of silk used by the High Empress. A strong thread, threaded in a crisscrossed pattern keeps the opening tight. The opening shows a generous amount of cleavage but not the whole breast. You cannot see their nipples through their tight midriff. You would only see the smooth skin of their inverted nipples. Only the High Empress can change the width of the opening. The midriff has a high and stiff collar. In cold weather, the High Empress allows them to wear a black silk cloak. They wear tight brown pants that covers the whole leg. They wear knee-high boots made of leather and tuck the pants in their boots. In the summer, the High Empress allows the Khatas to wear shorts or miniskirts. In formal martial events, they wear a highly decorated chest plate covering only their breast but a low cut and exposed midriff. Underneath is the midriff with the opening so they can take off the chest plate and still be in formal attire. On their shoulders, there are two, light and highly decorated, pauldrons. Connected to their pauldrons is a cape/cloak. They wear loose trousers with greaves and knee high leather boots. They have to wear a ferronniere on every occasion. In battle, they also have two sets of armor just like the High Empress. They have to wear the same armor as the High Empress. In the royal palace, they go topless with silk trousers and knee-high boots. They also wear a thick body chain, kept tight enough to keep firm. All of them are required to keep their long red hair loose. When they have to go to informal events or to go outside informally, they wear a bandeau and loose trousers, which they tuck in their knee-high leather boots.
