Iasedi’s Hold Architecture

Siudi’s Architecture
====================

The architecture in Siudi’s domain is simple. The material of each structure is a simple compound metal that is mined from the many mountains of Iasua. This metal is used as framework in the tall palaces that dominate cities in Iasua. Over these framework, glass imported from Thesgas is used to cover and build the remaining palace. Law in Iasua allows for specific buildings to be only made by specific material. For that reason, residential areas are constructed only out of stone. Larger residential areas, like residency towers, are made like palaces with compound metal and stone. Apart from residential areas, most of everything is built underground. Walls are created out of reinforced metal.

There are 7 major cities in Iasua. All settlements in Iasua are planned, as are all settlements in the Adasi system. Settlements are divided into 3 different types which are are strategically placed throughout the planet: a ville, a town, and a city.

A ville is the smallest type. Spread throughout the planet, the ville is the settlement type made the most and it's purpose is as a commune settlement. Each ville that is made is specialized in a sector of Iasua economy. All villes are equipped with an endoatmospheric vehicles hanger. All villes are organized so that at the center of each ville is a event center for meetings. Every housing is separated into a housing sector while another is separated into a commune sector that is closer to the hangar. Housing sectors are built only for ville administration. All other workers are transported by public vehicles or by their own transportation.

A town is mainly a residential type settlement. Villes are usually scattered around towns. Towns house workers that are required to work in ville commune area sector. Each town is equipped with an endoatmospheric vehicles hangar. Similar to a ville, the town is organized so that in the middle of the town is an event centers, while around it are sectors. Unlike villes, a town has a large residential sector and another service sector that contains service centers for different purposes like repairs, etc.

A city is the largest type of settlement. A city is basically a military base. But along with being a military base, it is also where the richest Teathudans build their mansions. All the cities contain a palace, strictly on the North side. Each city has 4 endoatmospheric vehicles hangar on all four directions, as well as an exoatmospheric vehicles hangar. All the cities have a wall each regularly set with guard towers. Any person can buy plotted walled mansions that are inside the city. Each mansion also comes with an underground plot that can be dug as per the wishes of the owner. The capital city is built a bit differently. While a normal city is built on and around one mountain, the capital city spans three mountains. On one mountain is where the massive palace of the Zoedashi is located while on the other two stands two fortresses. Connecting those is a thick metal wall. Inside the basin of these three mountains is where the mansions are located. A working sewer and water system waters each city. Obtaining a mansion in the capital city is one of the most prestigious things.

Shataie’s Architecture
======================

The architecture in the Shata’s domain is quite simple. The material of each structure is mostly hardened brick made from the local soil. These bricks are further improved upon by the Suasids to withstand natural disasters. These bricks are usually enforced with wood as framework while cement is also coated over the brick to make it more durable. The hardened bricks are used in almost every structure in Ausai, while the enhanced bricks, by the Suasids, are only used in large buildings because of the larger versatility they offer. Wood from the different large trees are used only in especially large structures, yet because of the environment of the planet structures cannot be as large as those of Siudi’s yet they are very widespread.

There are 6 major cities in Ausai. All settlements are always planned and built with the permission of the ruler with specific specifications. Settlements are identified in 3 different ways on the planet: a city, a clan and a tribe.

A tribe is the most basic type of settlement. A tribal settlement is usually indicated by a flag. Most tribal settlements are spread and are by far the most numerous of all types of settlements. Any Teathudan is usually born into a tribe and remains in the tribe for most of their lives. Each tribe mostly contains large mansions containing joint families. Each family is headed by an Esiti. A tribe never contains trading or manufacturing sectors and is only used for residential purposes. Each mansion has its own endoatmospheric vehicle and so communal hangar is not needed.

A clan is a settlement that contains around it many tribes. Mostly one island is occupied by one clan but there is occasionally a clan that occupies two particularly close islands. Each clan is controlled by one settlement where most merchants are based. Merchants set up their individual company’s headquarters in their clan settlement. Clan settlements are also where banks and other important buildings are located. For this reason a clan settlement is very fortified. Most services are also located in the clan settlements. Each clan supports multiple endoatmospheric hangar that go straight to a city for commune.

A city is the largest type of settlement. It is the center of trade and industry in Ausai. A city in Ausai contains a palace complex unlike any in Adasi and is mostly filled with markets and trading areas. Cities in Ausai are also popularly used for neutral meeting places. All cities contain a palace complex on the northern shore and always are half underwater. Only cities are allowed exoatmospheric hangar. All five cities are also used as a naval base for the whole planet and house a large airforce that are stored underwater. No residential buildings are allowed in cities for the safety of the people and the maintenance of peace. Each of the 5 Shataie use one of the 5 cities as their personal capital city. The capital city of Ausai is the last of the cities.
