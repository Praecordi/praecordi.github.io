Battle Armor
------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

The battle armour for the Goddess is made from a type of golden-steel alloy, that is very effective in battle. The helmet is a very unusual design, having a combination of cloth and metal. The metal part of the armor is the top circular helmet that also has a single spike on the top. A long sand colored turban is wrapped around it that allows a better adaption for the sandy weather of the desert. A piece of the cloth can be wrapped and unwrapped over the mouth and nose to protect from the wind and sand. She wears a sandy colored midriff with no sleeves. Her hands are wrapped in sand colored cloth that contain hidden blades in both of them. The chestplate is a golden plate armor that does not cover the midriff to minimize weight. It bends out to deflect blows. From the corner of the midriff connected chains extend out to connect to a cut ruby in the back. On the back is also a back harness for the Goddess' scimitars. Underneath the top, there is a sand colored cloth that is wrapped around the crotch to form a kind of skirt. Over the skirt is a belt that has a golden buckle with a ruby in the middle. Her legs are also wrapped with a sand colored cloth that is wrapped all the way to the knee. Golden greaves are put over the wrappings with chains extending out.
