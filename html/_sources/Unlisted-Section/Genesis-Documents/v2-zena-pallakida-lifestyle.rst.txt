Dimidium Zena Pallakida
=======================

The lifestyle of an average Dimidian is simple. Most live Dimidians live with the Elit that mated with her. They share a room with a fellow Dimidian mate. Most Elit keep about four Dimidis as wives. If an Elit has more than six Dimidian mates then the society considers her too sexual. The day starts with washing the body. The two Dimidian mates bath together and sometimes the Elit can join their bath. After the bath, they check their egg or eggs in the incubator. If their eggs have already hatched then they start to make their breakfast with the other mates. Most families eat breakfast together. After the breakfast, the children usually play while the Dimidians go to their respective workplace. One Dimidian mate pair will usually stay at the house to look after the kids or eggs. The average Dimidian usually works in a service. The mates of an Elit that works in the army will usually be under the command of that Elit. The imperial harem contains only Dimidians that have not mated. Most of the family eats their lunch separately. The Dimidians usually start making dinner after they arrive. The kids sleep after dinner while the Dimidians talk of the day. The Elit usually come to the bed of the Dimidi mate pair to have sex. After mating, an Elit never has sex with only one Dimidi if she has more than one Dimidian mate. A Dimidi that does not have a mate usually lives with her parent Elit until an Elit mates with her. A grown Dimidian who has not mated and lives at her parent's house will make breakfast and dinner and go to a job just like the other Dimidians. The first time the Dimidian inserts her fluid in an Elit, she will be the Elit's mate and goes to live in her house.

====================

The lifestyle of an average Elit is a little more complicated than a Dimidians. An Elit usually sleeps alone or with another Elit mate she has. When an Elit has another Elit as a mate, they either stay in a house alone with that mate or live in a large mansion with that Elit’s mate and other Dimidian mate they have. When two Elit mate and one of the Elit has Dimidian mates the other Elit has to mate with the Dimidian mates. Most Elit when they have mated with an Elit mate do not mate with Dimidian mate because it produces too many children. The average day of an Elit with only Dimidian mates is quite simple. A traditional system of creating harmony between mates was developed. The system was that the Elit put two of her Dimidian mates together in a room and everything from making breakfast to having sex with the Elit be done together. The Elit chooses if she wants to take her bath alone or with a mate pair. When she chooses to have bath with a mate pair and she has more than one mate pair then she has to take a bath with the other mate pairs during the next consecutive days. Not doing that can cause dissension among the family and ruin social status of the family. After the bath, the Dimidians make breakfast. After breakfast, the Elit goes to work. The Elit returns at around dinnertime. Everyone eats dinner and puts the children to sleep. Then the Elit leads a small talk of the day's happenings. After that, they goes to bed. Some days, the Elit goes to the bedroom of mate pair to have sex. Again, when an Elit has more than one mate pair then the Elit has to go to the other mate pair for the next consecutive days. An Elit has to take care of her Dimidian mates and sometimes has to engage in sex with her mate even if she does not want to. On days, the Elit does not have to go to work she stays home and takes care of the children. An Elit with another Elit as a mate leads a simpler life if they do not have Dimidian mates too. When two Elit live together, they usually sleep together. When they wake up one Elit makes breakfast while the other takes care of children. That same Elit usually goes to work. An Elit stays home every other day. After the Elit that went to work comes, she makes dinner and the Elits and children eat. After putting, the children to sleep, the Elits have sex and then go to sleep. Two Elit mates have sex every day. When two Elit also have Dimidian mates then it gets a little complicated for the Elit. The Elits usually sleep together. When they wake, the Elits take their bath together. After breakfast, they go to their work. The Elits usually work together. That is usually where two Elit meet. They have their lunch together. When they return they return right before dinner. After having dinner, they put the children to sleep. Then they lead a talk of the days happening and then go to sleep. When the Elit wants to have sex with the Dimidi, all of them go to the room of the mate pair. One of them has sex with the mate pair first and then the other. Then they go to their room and have sex together. Some of the time, they have sex together in the mate pair's room while they watch. This happen again the next day if the Elit pair have another mate pair. When an Elit is young without a mate, she lives in her parent Elit's home. She does everything like her Elit parents but does not start work until later. She usually takes care of her siblings. She also helps her Dimidian parents help make dinner. She also takes part in the talk of the day’s happenings.
