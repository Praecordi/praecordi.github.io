The Goddess Sibyl's kingdom is one of the most advanced kingdoms out of all the other Goddesses. The Goddess herself is very beautiful among even Goddess standards. She is shorter than the Empress but about as tall as the Goddess Al-Manat. Her skin is pale white. Her eyes are almond shape with long eyelashes and amber color. Her pupils are two vertical slits. Her eyes have full nictitating membrane. Her hair has a golden color with a curl in the end. Her ears are slightly pointed. She has full lips and a high cheekbone. Her nose is small and slightly upturned. Her neck is small and slope downwards to fairly wide shoulders. Her arms are long and there are six fingers on each arm: four fingers and two thumbs. Her hips are voluptuous and enticing. Her breast are quite large and strong enough to hold themselves without support. Like the other Goddesses her light nipples are inverted. Her legs are longer than her upper body. Her vagina looks tight and have a soft pink tone. The toes are like humans containing five fingers.

Dress
=====

Royal Dress
-----------

The dress of the Goddess is the traditional dress that is worn on celebratory occasions. It was originally designed to be very modest unlike other Goddess’ culture but isn't successful because of the doctrine. Originally, the dress would fully cover almost the whole body from the feet to the neck.

The whole dress is a light green color mixed with the occasional yellow. The top midriff is long sleeved, high necked midriff that is slightly tight. Lace spills out of the sleeves and the collar and the bottom of the midriff. The midriff is double breasted and so has two lines of buttons. The buttons are golden. The midriff is tight to give a very desirable shape yet because of the hard material nothing much is revealed. The skirt is long and reaches all the way to the floor. Underneath there is usually little worn except for an underwear. When the occasion requires dancing that may show the crotch, loose pants are worn. The skirt has strips on the side that is slightly transparent, enough to show some skin. The skirt is usually worn high but when the Empresses are present they are lowered considerably for thier pleasure. The shoes are white and cover most of the ankle. The shoes are also buttoned on by golden buttons.

Battle Dress
============

Battle Armor
------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

The armor is made of a strong metal with a compound metal added into it to make it eight times lighter than normal. The helmet is a barbute and designed to reduce what little drag it has. It has the same inbuilt biconcave lens so that you can look farther than usual. It also has the hard leather in the barbute to protect the mouth from dust. The chest armor is plate armor that covers most of the breast. It also curves outward to provide maximum deflection. A pixane and a gorget protect the neck and cover skin left by the chestplate. Unlike the heavy armor, the light armor bares the midriff to reduce weight for speed. The pauldrons are smaller and lighter, designed to reduce drag. It connects with the usual cape/cloak, which is made of lighter material. The vambrace and the rerebrace are not connected but the rerebrace connects lightly with the gauntlet. The arm armor reduces drag as all the other armors. The gauntlet has excellent grip on any material. The armor on the crotch provides less protection and more maneuverability. A fauld covers and protects the hips and is designed to reduce drag. The leg armor contains four parts: poleyn, cuisse, tasset, and greaves. They also reduce the little drag they have. The sabatons are made of lighter material and the wearer wears leather socks to make it more comfortable. Iron studded sabatons reinforce kicks. The belt has a loop to carry the Goddess' sword.
