Deae Bellatrix
==============


The Goddess Dea and the Goddess Thea are identical twins. They are natural tacticians in battle and have the best army after the Goddess Tengri. The might of the Goddess Dea is based upon the superior machines of war that she has to offer and a highly disciplined army. Although the Goddess Thea has machines, she is more specialized in the use of navy and water power. It is said that the pair combined are undefeatable in battle. They live separately and have developed different traditions and culture. Although they are similar in many ways, one can differentiate from them. Of the twins the Goddess Dea is the older one of them by 80 seconds. Because of that she is called the Deae Bellatrix, an addition to her name. The Goddess Dea looks similar to the Goddess Thea. They have a slight but muscular body. They reach about the height of the Empress. She has a narrow face and small eyes with yellow pupils that are vertical slits. Her nose is slightly upturned and her lips are full. She has pointed ears and a high cheekbones. Her hair is long and wavy with a golden color with a red permanent color on the tip to help differentiate her from the Goddess Thea. She has a long neck that slopes to a broad shoulder and long arms. She has perfect breast about the size of the Empress and inverted nipples that are dark when they pop. She has six fingers on each of her arm: 2 thumbs and 4 fingers. Her legs are long and her vagina is a beautiful sight. They are small and tight with a velvety feel to them. Although they have been penetrated a lot by some of the biggest things one can imagine they retain the shape of when they first matured. Her feet are normal with 5 fingers each.

Dress 
======

Royal Dress
-----------

The dress of the Goddess Dea is a formal dress that she wears in the meeting with the council. Although she is the Goddess a group of council is elected every 100 years to advice the Goddess. The dress of the Goddess Dea is similar to the first dress of the Goddess Thea but not same. There are two versions of the dress, one is for the meeting while one is for a public appearances.

The version, reserved for the meeting, is slightly insulated because of the usual cold temperature inside the meeting room but is loose because of some occasional time when the meeting room is hot. The top is a loose white midriff with two red stripes right over the nipples of the breast. The midriff is strangely made. It has long sleeves that stick to the arm. The cloth that covers the chest hangs loose not being tight under the breast so that if one looks underneath the midriff, they would easily see the breasts. Usually the Goddess doesn’t wear anything underneath. On the hands the Goddess wears white gloves that seem to smoothly blend into the white sleeves. Underneath the Goddess wears a long skirt also with two red stripes and is pleated between the stripes. The skirt is made from a heavy material that is very warm. On the feet the Goddess wears sandals that are crisscrossed straps that extend all the way to the knees.

This version of the dress is just a little different from the version that the Goddess wears for the meeting. The midriff is the same. It has a long sleeve that is very tight. The part of the midriff that covers the chest is very loose but a belt holds the loose part close so that people do not see the Goddess’ breasts. The midriff is made in such a way so as to expose the shoulders and reveal some cleavage. The tight sleeves, in this case, do not go all the way to the shoulders but stop right on top of the arm. They extend only to the point so as to connect with the main midriff. This connection is unlike normal connection between a sleeve and midriff. The midriff is connected very loosely by a cloth that extends out from the midriff and connects to the sleeves so that, unlike normal connection, the armpirts are exposed if the hand is raise. Instead of a skirt, the Goddess wears white loose pants. The sandals are the same as the version before with crisscrossed straps that extend all the way to the knee.

Battle Dress

Battle Armor
------------

Description 
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The armor of the Goddess Dea is very effective. The armor is also similar in most styles with the armor of her soldiers. Her highly trained soldiers combined with this armor is very strong coming close to the army of the Goddess Tengri. It is a mainly infantry armor and paired with a large shield. The helmet is a steel cap with side pieces to protect the ears. The helmet for the Goddess is also bordered with gold and a red plume coming from the top. The armor itself is a laminar. It has a fully laminar chestplate with shoulder pieces also laminar. The chestplate is made very strangely. Unlike the traditional way of sewing the front and back under the armpit, the laminar armor of the Goddess is made already connected. The laminar strips are made of a flexible metal and so are able to create a bent portion in the armor that allows it to encompass the whole body without a break in the armor itself. The front is shortened a bit to expose the midriff while the back fully extends all the way to the back. A scarf can be seen which is connected with the midriff inside. A cape bordered with fur near the neck is also worn by the Goddess during all times. The bottom is a skirt, about knee length, that is part of the tunic worn inside the armor. Over the skirt is a belt out which spill out leather straps. The Goddess wears sandals made to be hardy and used in any conditions. The sandals have a hard heel and are just leather straps crisscrossed extending all the way to the knee.
