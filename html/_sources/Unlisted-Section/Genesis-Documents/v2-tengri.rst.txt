Dress
=====

Royal Dress
-----------

This dress is a traditional uniform that the Goddess wears most of the time. There are two versions of this dress: one is made for mild weather while one is made for cold weather. The tradition of a Goddess always keeping the midriff open is introduced by the High Empress.

On the head, there is a leather circlet containing Her long brown hair. The top is a type of wrapping with white cloth. It creates a type of one-strapped midriff. The cloth used to make this is similar to the human silk. A cloth is wrapped right under the breast and tied underneath the left arm. A special clothing piece, which contains only a sleeve for the left side, is worn. The cloth hangs down over the left breast and a belt is tied underneath to secure the cloth and accentuate the breasts. On the bottom is a very revealing skirt. It is a white underwear over which is tied a belt with a silver buckle. A white cloth is hung on the right side of the belt and wraps very loosely around to the left side of the back. It reveals a lot of skin. The underwear is just a way to cover the private parts. Underneath these are sandals.

The winter version is a little less revealing. Instead of a circlet on the top there is a hoody that is attached with a midriff. The hood is lined at the end with fur for more insulation. A part of the midriff extends a little below the normal length used by the Goddess Al-Manat. It is also double breasted, one side overlaps the other and buttoned twice. Like the summer version, the right sleeve is missing showing the shoulder and part of the bust. The left sleeve extends all the way down to the hand. On the left hand is a heavy glove. The edge of the fabric is lined with fur. To protect the right hand and still keep the dress traditional the Goddess wears a special right sided cloak lined with heavy fur on the top. On the bottom, She wears brown silk pants. A belt is tied over the pants with a silver buckle. The shoes are knee-high and also edged with fur.

Battle Armor

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

The battle armor of Tengri is unique. It is the best of the other Goddess in open warfare. The helmet is made of metal and has laminar flaps on the side that extend all the way to the the neck. This helps protect the back and sides of the neck. The chest armor covers only the chest and exposes the midriff. There are many layers under the original laminar chest armor made of hard scale skin. In the very beginning is a long sleeve shirt made of transparent silk that is tucked in the pants. Over that are layers of thick leather midriffs. And then comes the laminar armor. The armor is made of strips of scaled skin that are sewn together at the ends. A similar arrangement is made for the back although unlike the front the whole of the back is covered. In from the laminar armor is made so that it slopes outward and curves back in right above the midriff. The back armor and the front armor are sewn together by metal wire but can be taken out later. The laminar armor has a sleeve that slopes a little down the shoulder. The Goddess wears leather gloves to help with shooting the bow and keeping the cold out. The armor for the legs is a long skirt that reaches to the midway of the lower leg. This skirt is made of laminar armor too and is cut in the middle to ride. Underneath this the Goddess wears a thick pants although it is not meant to do anything except cover the lower portion of the Goddess. The shoes are designed to walk on a grassy land and not make much noise. They are made of soft leather with no hard soles.
