==================
Idae Zheadi’s Hold
==================


Each of the Zoedashie in Idae’s Hold represents a culture that is held together by that Zoedashi. Each of the Zoedashi from Idae’s hold was transformed from as Iroe to this form using the same methods although the proportion of Red Light used in their transformation was only a fourth compared to three fourth used in Idae’s transformation. Each Zoedashi also has the same number of keystones in the same location as the Isitetho.

.. rubric:: Royal Dress

The dress of Tae is a beautiful dress fit for the slim Zoedashi. The whole dress uses a single, long, red cloth that is thick enough to cover most of the upper legs when starting from the waist. The dress starts off first on the right leg and wrapped around to the left side. The two sides are equaled out and then tied together into a knot. Both flaps sides from the knot are push over to the right shoulder, one from the front and one from the back. The one from the front is made sure to be below the right breast to maintain the doctrine. The two cloth are again tied over the right shoulder. Then one of the cloth is taken and wrapped loosely around the right arm, while the other is loosely wrapped around the left arm. Both cloths are then attached to a ring worn on the hand of the same side. Golden arm bands are worn on the upper arm around the cloth to keep the cloth in place. A golden necklace with rubies usually adorn the neck of the Zoedashi during most occasions. A golden chain hangs off the knot at the waist which has a giant stone of ruby at the end. On the feet are strapped sandals that reach the knees.

For the addition to the dress, the Zoedashi wears a cloak that is hung by two golden, brooches. One of these brooches is attached to the cloth that is right under the cleavage, while the other one is in the same position in the back. The cloak goes under the arm, and makes sure the midriff is completely covered. The cloak extends all the way to the bottom of the floor, and covers only the right side, keeping the left side exposed.

Tash Adishe 
------------

.. rubric:: Description 

The Zoedashi Tash is the tallest of all the Zoedashi. Her beautiful white skin can only be matched by the Zoedashi Seshi and the Isitetho. Her eyes are small, but extremely accurate. Unlike many Iroe, the Zoedashi has different eye colors for both eyes. While her right eye is purple, her left eye is blue. Her eyelashes are short and less likely to block her way. Her hair is a flowing golden color that is long enough to reach her crotch. Her ears are similar to the rest of the Zoedashi, yet much less sensitive. Her lips are full and colored a light red which still stand out from her white skin. She has a less muscular build than the other Zoedashi, because of her role as a thinker than a fighter. The Zoedashi Tash’s breast are large, the same size as the Zoedashi Tae’s. Her legs are longer than her upper body. She has 5 toes on each foot. The Red Light has enhanced Zoedashi Tash’s memory and brain power, yet has not changed her physically.

.. rubric:: Royal Dress 

The Royal Dress of Zoedashi Tash is an elegant piece that exposes much of the glowing white skin of the Zoedashi. The top is a wrapping of a circular piece of light blue cloth that is thick enough to cover most of the stomach. The cloth is spread over the stomach and then crossed over on the back. The loop that is made in the back is then brought over the head. The cloth is the neatly folded and rests on the Zoedashi’s neck. The bottom are light purple smooth pants of a stretchy material that conform to the body. The waistline of the pant slopes such that it covers and exposes different parts of the legs. The angle of the slope is slant enough to cover the crotch. The right waist line slopes up all the way to the bottom of the breasts. The pants go over the circular cloth, and is tucked into the upper part of the circular cloth to stop it from falling. The left slopes down and exposes most of the left thigh. The left side of the pant then continues all the way to the ankles while the right side stops above the thighs, exposing most of the lower right leg. The right side slopes at the same angle as the waistline does mimicking the slant. Knee high shoes are worn on the feet. The right boot also mimics the slope of the waistline.

The only addition to the dress of the Zoedashi Tash is a cloak that acts more like a cape. Attached to the wrapping near the neck this purple cape extends all the way to the floor.

Seshi Adishe
------------

.. rubric:: Description 

The Zoedashi Seshi is probably the most beautiful of all Zoedashi. Her skin is a brilliant white, only matched by the Isitetho. Her eyes are large, and very beautiful. The pupils are a light yellow and orange shade, which is striking to look at. Her eyelashes are long and elegant. Her hair is a waterfall of brown with touches of golden color at the end. Her ears are short, yet pointed like the rest of the Zoedashi. Her lips are thin and colored a light pink. The Zoedashi Seshi is very heavyset and muscular. Her shoulder are wide, with bulging muscles and slope down from her neck. The Zoedashi’s breast are the largest of the Zoedashie and the Isitetho. Her nipples are dark, almost as dark as those of Zoedashi Tae, increasing the contrast between her white skin. Her legs are as long as her body. She has 5 toes in each feet. The Red Light gives the Zoedashi Seshi enhanced muscles, making her much more stronger than the other Zoedashie and also explaining her size.

.. rubric:: Royal Dress 

The Royal Dress of Seshi is one of the richest display. The top of Seshi’s Royal Dress is made purely of a gold. This golden plate armor is molded according to the figure of the Zoedashi, and fits her perfectly such that it seems that the plate seems to be her real body. The plate exposes her midriff and has curving top where the Zoedashi’s breast can rest. While the plate does cover much of the front, it covers the whole back. A long cloth of light green cloth is worn on top as a decoration. It is wrapped around the neck from the back and falls down from the shoulders. Both sides of the green cloth is securely placed over either of the Zoedashi’s breasts so as to not cover them, and only act as a decoration to enhance the dress. They are then wrapped around the arms of the opposite side of the cloth. Flowing down from the plate is light green cloth adorned with orange that extends all the way down to the ankles. This skirt is made from thick cloth and is carefully slit from the bottom of the knees in the middle front and back and on the sides. This creates four flaps of the skirt that create an impressive effect in windy weather and also provides an easier time to walk. On the foot, the Zoedashi wears light green, knee high shoes with golden buttons.

For the addition, thin but densely packed golden chains are attached to the plate that hide the midriff. These chains manage to cover most of the midriff but movement might reveal some skin, and thus is considered somewhat scandalous in Ocae.
