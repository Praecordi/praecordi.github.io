Saisheta’s Hold Architecture

Teshi’s Architecture
====================

Teshi’s domain has the least amount of cities in the whole system, although she controls one of the largest planets. Most Pallakidans live movable type homes. For short distances they transport via Jhiushes while for longer distances they use endoatmospheric vehicles. The material used for building is similar to that of the Shataie. Hardened bricks are used for normal buildings while enhanced bricks are used for larger structures. Unlike Shataie’s hold, metal is used a support instead of wood. Most buildings use neither hardened nor enhanced brick. Instead grown cloth is used as minor protection against weather.

Despite the size of the planet, Edhiujha has eight major cities carefully spread across the planet. Each settlement is planned like every other planet’s settlements. There is only one type of permanent settlement which is the city.

The movable settlement usually consists of a hearth around which the tents are placed. The chief's tent is usually placed right next to the hearth. A stable is located outside the settlement. A hangar for endoatmospheric vehicles are not moved and are located at some oasis or city.

The cities is located are located around nine of the largest reservoirs around the planet. Each city is surrounded by five fortresses that are each connected by walls. An area underground is dedicated to farming. Each of the fortresses contains an exoatmospheric vehicle hangar. Endoatmospheric hangars are scattered alongside the walls towards the inside. Each of the cities has a working sewer and water system. The cities inner contains shops where many foreigners frequent. Factories for the shop are located outside the walls. Surrounding the inner city are walled mansions. The mansions are large and take a majority of the city. The capital city is unique in that it is located beside a particularly large hill. The entrance of the city is adorned with large statues of Jhuishes. The fortresses surround the hill where the palace is located. The hill is also hollowed out to contain the large army of Teshi. The palace itself is made of gold, hardened brick and steel.

Dea’s Architecture
==================

The architecture in Dea’s domain is quite similar to that of Thea’s. There are many differences though they seem minor. The material most often used in buildings is a cement made from a mixture of ash found in the volanoes Jhedhui. Only public buildings, such as the bath, amphitheatre, temples, are made of natural material like marble. Metal reinforcement are used to support large buildings. The Zoedashi herself doesn’t live in a particularly large palace, although her mansion is slightly larger than the other wealthy Pallakidans.

There are 3 major cities in Jhedhui. All cities are planned. The settlements in Jhedhui are divided into 5 types of settlements: city, town, village, villae of which there are two type.

The villae is the smallest type of settlement. A villae is a grouping of houses that does not contain a meeting place for governance. There are two types of villae: one consists of mansions, while the other consists of smaller houses. Villae are usually planned but most do not have a working sewer or water system. The larger villae that contain mansions have enough funding to create one for themselves. A endoatmospheric hangar is usally placed near the edge of the border. Villae also do not have walls. Most villaes are made to group mansions and are farther away from the city.

A village on the other hand, has an elected governing body and a public building specifically dedicated to them. A village like a villae is also planned and usually has a sewer system, while water is obtained from a well near the center of the village. The governing body also acts as a judiciary system for the village itself or the surrounding villae. A village is also usually filled with the working class. The village will have an endoatmospheric hangar near its outskirts. Just like a villae, the village will not have any walls for protection.

A town will have a building for its governing body and also an amphitheatre for the entertaninment of its people. The amphitheatre would be located near the center of the town along with any other public buildings. A town will be located near a volcano for power and will usually contain a wall specificall designed to protect it from the eruptions of the volcano. A town, while it does have residential areas, will primarily have factories and production buildings. These buildings will be organized according to their type by the town planners when making a town. A town will also be the place for markets for buying and selling goods. An endoatmospheric hangar will be located near the edge of the town but inside the walls.

The city is by far the largest type of settlement. The city will have primarily everything a town has, and it will be located at the coast line. The city is also the place where many of the rich in the area gather for entertainment. A city will not have it’s own governing body but will be directly in command of the Zoedashi. The city will usually have docks for floating vehicles, endoatmospheric hangars and an exoatmospheric hangar of planetary travel. The city will also host the army of the Zoedashi and be the command center for the patrols launced by the Zoedashi throughout the continents. The city will have both a water and sewer system. Public buildings are usually spread out throughout the city. The Zoedashi's mansion is located in the largest of cities. The mansions in the city are made much more differently from any other mansion. Each mansion is designed to hold a full family. The mansion itself will be built around a central garden around which individual rooms are built. Each of the room share the wall. The mansions are more than one stories tall. The Zoedashi's mansion is a combination of three of these mansions interconnected.

Thea’s Architecture
===================

The architecture in Thea’s domain is quite similar to that of Dea’s. There are many differences though they seem minor. The material most often used in buildings is the natural stone found in the crust of Jhedhiu. Metal is used as reinforcements. The architecture of Thea is also very influenced by religion. The Zoedashi herself doesn’t live in a particularly large palace, but a temple.

There are 5 major cities in Jhedhiu. All cities are planned. The settlements in Jhedhui are divided into 4 types of settlements: city, town, village, villae .

The villae is the smallest type of settlement. A villae is a grouping of houses that does not contain a meeting place for governance. Houses in a villae are usually larger mansions and vacation houses. Most villae are not planned and do not grow to be too large. A villae also does not contain any endoatmospheric hangar as most people who do live in a villae can afford to have a hangar inside their mansion. Villae also do not have walls. Most villaes are made to group mansions and are farther away from the city. A villae will also be dedicated to one of the gods in the Adasi pantheon and a temple will be built in honor of them.

A village on the other hand, has an elected governing body and a public building specifically dedicated to them. A village is planned and usually has a sewer system, while water is obtained from a well near the center of the village. The governing body also acts as a judiciary system for the village itself or the surrounding villae. A village is also usually filled with the working class. The village will have an endoatmospheric hangar near its outskirts. Just like a villae, the village will not have any walls for protection. Most vilages are also dedicated to one of the gods and will have a temple loacted near the public buildings.

A town will have a building for its governing body and also an amphitheatre for the entertaninment of its people. The amphitheatre would be located near the center of the town along with any other public buildings. A town will be located near a volcano for power and will usually contain a wall specificall designed to protect it from the eruptions of the volcano. A town, while it does have residential areas, will primarily have factories and production buildings. These buildings will be organized according to their type by the town planners when making a town. A town will also be the place for markets for buying and selling goods. An endoatmospheric hangar will be located near the edge of the town but inside the walls.

The city is by far the largest type of settlement. The city will have primarily everything a town has, and it will be located at the coast line. The city is also the place where many of the rich in the area gather for entertainment. A city will not have its own governing body but will be directly in command of the Zoedashi. The city will usually have docks for floating vehicles, endoatmospheric hangars and an exoatmospheric hangar of planetary travel. The city will also host the army of the Zoedashi and be the command center for the patrols launched by the Zoedashi throughout the continents. The city will have both a water and sewer system. Public buildings are usually spread out throughout the city. The Zoedashi lives in the largest of cities. A city will not be dedicated to any one of the god in the Adasi pantheon but instead will contain a ring of temples for all the primary deities in the middle of the city. The Zoedashi lives in the temple for Honor personified. The mansions in the city are made much more differently from any other mansion. Each mansion is designed to hold a full family. The mansion itself will be built around a central garden around which individual rooms are built. Each of the room share the wall. The mansions are more than one stories tall.
