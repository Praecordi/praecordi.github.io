Dress

Royal Dress
-----------

This dress is a ceremonial dress conducted during the first day of a new year. This day, the Goddess Ma' Sekhis selects selects two couples may it be Dimidi and Elit or Elit and Elit. The Goddess would have the two couples have sex amongst each other and then have sex with her. This ceremony is also open to everyone and is taken place at the crotch of the monument made of Ma' Sekhis. Ma' Sekhis wears this dress for the first part of the ceremony and while giving the speech. There is another version of the dress which is used for interplanetary meetings.

The dress is very revealing and easy to take off and put on. The top part is a rectangular cloth with a knot connecting the points. The knot then goes over the right shoulder and a belt is worn right under the breast and over the cloth so that it is secure. The result is a midriff that that has only one strap. Usually the Goddess also wears jewelry like a golden body chain, arm cuffs and anklets. The bottom is a very revealing skirt that is tied on. A belt is worn first, then a long cloth is pleated and then tucked in on the left side. It is then wrapped around once to the right side. After that the one wrap, the end is taken under the the belt and brought over loosely to make a loose end in the middle. The Goddess rarely wears underwear in the skirt but sometimes when the occasion is serious she will wear something underneath. On her feet are sandals that are brown and reach all the way to the knee.

This version of the dress is used for interplanetary meetings. It is not as revealing as the normal version of the dress. The bottom part of the dress is the most similar while the top part is completely different. The top is actually two long rectangular pieces of white cloth. The first piece goes is placed over te left breast. The top part is then taken to the back over the right shoulder while the bottom part is taken from under the armpits and tied at the back with the top end. The same is done with the second piece on the right breast. The top end is taken over the left shoulder. Two more cloths are used as suspensions so that the midriff doesn’t slip off the breast. These clothes are tucked into the part of the midriff underneath the armpit and then tied around the belt to keep them down and stretched out enough. In the end, the top is a midriff that completely covers the two breast, revealing nothing from the sides or the front. The bottom is just like that of the original version but instead, the Goddess wears a set of capris underneath it. The sandals are just like that of the original dress.

Battle Armor

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

The armor of Ma’ Sekhis is made of an alloy of gold and steel. The helmet depicts a snake-like creature baring 8 fangs. It is has an open front while the rest of the helmet covers the back and neck. The breastplate is like the clothing of Ma’ Sekhis very revealing. The breastplate, unlike that of all the other Goddesses, perfectly molds the breast and makes it feel like there is nothing covering the breast. Although underneath the breastplate, red cloth is wrapped over the breasts. Pauldrons cover the shoulders that depict the same snake-like creature showing its 8 fangs. The arm is covered by a golden colored scale armor that allows easy movement. Red gloves are worn by the Goddess. From the breast plate, a protrusion protrudes out and reaches the middle of the belly. A ruby is inlaid at the end of the protrusions. The bottom is open. The Goddess wears a kind of armor that covers only the waist. This armor covers the parts of the body normally an underwear would like the crotch and the backsides. A protrusion comes out of this armor in the very front that is longer than the actual armor. It extends all the way to the knees and covers the crotch. Underneath this armor is a red skirt. This skirt is molded in a way just like the armor. The skirt is longer in the back, long enough to reach the floor, and shorter in the front. On the bottom of the legs are greaves under which red cloth is wrapped tightly around the leg. The Goddess wears nothing underneath the skirt and so if someone were to look underneath the skirt, the private parts of the Goddess would be seen. The shoes are made of leather and have slight heels.
