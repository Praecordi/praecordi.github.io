The Goddess Dea and the Goddess Thea are identical twins. They are natural tacticians in battle and have the best army after the Goddess Tengri.

Battle Armor

Description 
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The battle armor of the Goddess Thea reflects her different culture from her twin, the Goddess Dea. The armor of the Goddess Thea is made to show the body’s perfection. The helmet is of a distinct style. Metal covers the cheeks while there is a protrusion from the top of the eye slits that cover the middle. The chestplate is different than that of any other Goddess. The chestplate has no straps or parts over the shoulder. To expose the midriff, the part in front of the midriff is taken out completely. But, to make sure that the chestplate doesn’t fall down the whole back is kept. The result is a metal part that covers only the chest and isn’t supported by the shoulders. It is connected to the back, which fully covers the back and molds to the shape of the back. The chestplate in the front doesn’t mold to the shape of the body so as the deflect attacks, rather the plate curves out. To protect the shoulders there are two pauldrons that extend cover most of the skin left by the chestplate. A separate arm armor is worn to cover the whole arm and also provides sufficient movement. In the bottom the Goddess wears cotton pants. Just like Goddess Dea, the Goddess Thea wears a type of belt with leather straps that hang loose.

The Goddess Thea wears a cape that is connected with the arm armor.
