======================
The Full Pantheon [1]_
======================


So far, the only godly beings I included in my posts were Pheruksa, the goddess who made the world as we know it, and her Three Daughters - the Land, the Sun, and the Moon. There are, however, plenty of other goddesses in Rankvah.

Spending millennia managing the world, the people, and the events of everything in Rankvah is not easy. For that reason, Pheruksa and the Three Daughters went on to make other lower goddesses to manage specific parts of the world in their place. These goddesses each have their own niche, which was inspired by Rankvahn society itself.

The Pantheon
============

Each goddess is known by a name, but has titles depending on the level and purpose of her worship, and also has a personality and other details. A goddess’ patronage is the groups of people favored by the goddess. For example, if a woman who is both a Houndfolk and a guard prayed to Centia, she’d be inclined to answer because of the person being a guard. If that same person prayed to Kvilkovoa, she’d be inclined to answer because of the person being a Houndfolk. Additionally, each goddess has domains, which are the parts of the world (or its workings) that the goddess oversees.

Another point to consider is that all goddesses are intangible, most of the time, and exist as the entirety of their domain, but whenever they want to visit the world, they can assume a physical form and blend in. Said physical forms are not seen as the same for everyone, but it is agreed that all goddesses take forms of the purest beauty, tweaked to signify their domain, and each goddess’ physical form is indestructible by mortal means. To injure a goddess, one must be a goddess.

Finally, a goddess can also enter an active worshiper’s body. She can either let the mortal still have control, or she can completely take over the body. No goddess has ever caused a fatality this way, though having a divine being inside your body can disrupt many of your bodily functions. The moment the goddess leaves your body, her physical support of your systems will end, and you will need about three days of rehabilitation for each hour the goddess was inside you, or a week if she was the one controlling your body.

Anket
-----

   :Patronage: Humans, husbands, masters

   :Domains: Sexual love, charisma, sexual dominance

   :Personality and Details: Anket is a goddess of true dominance. No matter how strong your will is, you will not be able to resist her charms, and you will not be able to manipulate her back. She is more than happy to bestow sexual love to anyone who worships her frequently. Anket is the husband of Skezna, another goddess in the pantheon.

   *Small reminder “Husband” and “Wife” in Rankvahn society imply levels
   of dominance in marriage, and don’t imply sex since every human is
   the same sex.*

Centia
------

   :Patronage: Beastfolk, guards, knights

   :Domains: Martial arts, travel, justice

   :Personality and Details: Centia is a serious and level-headed goddess. In her mind, a just world is an ideal world. She would sometimes go out of her way to trip criminals running away, or surge the guards chasing them down with stamina and speed. Additionally, people who take trials lightly are prone to her anger, and lying in court or faking evidence can get you severe pains in multiple places. Centia is the husband of Hizperta and Vulpintaht, two other goddesses in the pantheon.

Gemira
------

   :Patronage: Dragonfolk, sages, academics

   :Domains: Science, wisdom

   :Personality and Details: More than anything, Gemira loves a good story. She frequently hops down to the mortal world to enjoy plays and books she hasn’t yet experienced. She expresses her gratitude to those who pray to her frequently by granting them wisdom and insight.

Hizperta
--------

   :Patronage: Birdfolk, mail deliverers

   :Domains: Communication, flight, winds

   :Personality and Details: Hizperta enjoys riding the wind and seeing where they lead her. Even after knowing every nook and crevice of the world, she still finds joy in seeing what new winds can take her. While her overseen domains are no joke, she doesn’t take her job too seriously, and is more than willing to change the direction of wind itself to race a Birdfolk during her flight, then ask to see what that Birdfolk was carrying. Hizperta is the wife of Centia, another goddess in the pantheon.

Skezna
------

   :Patronage: Houndfolk [2]_, wives, slaves

   :Domains: Romantic love, sexual submission, fertility

   :Personality and Details: As a goddess of romantic love and sexual submission, Skezna is a very passive and gentle goddess. Her reign over fertility also gives her the ability to control whose love is strong enough to deserve pregnancy. Skezna is the wife of Anket, another goddess in the pantheon.

Kvilkovoa
---------

   :Patronage: Snakefolk [3]_, nature-workers

   :Domains: Nature, sexual love, destiny

   :Personality and Details: As someone bound to the forces unknown to humanity, Kvilkovoa longs for company, but can never bring herself to actively seek out people. She often accidentally gets in her own way by summoning storms to arrive at the same day she planned to walk on the street and talk to people. Sudden floods or blazing heatwaves are her backfired attempts to get close to people.

Tulkata
-------

   :Patronage: Catfolk, nudists, acrobats

   :Domains: Beauty, physical dexterity

   :Personality and Details: Tulkata is a goddess full of energy, and is somewhat impulsive. Challenge her to a game of tying spider strings, and she’ll not only win almost immediately, but will get bored watching you try and tie your spider strings herself.

Vulpintaht
----------

   :Patronage: People with sexual disorders, people with disabilities

   :Domains: Sexual pleasure, orgasms, disabilities

   :Personality and Details: As the goddess of sexual pleasure and orgasms, there isn’t a moment in the day she isn’t aroused or climaxing. Anything is a sex toy to her, be it a tree branch, a sword, a single drop of water, or even her own arousal. She is also the goddess of disabilities, and gets around with the help of her husband, Centia, another goddess in the pantheon. Any disability you could think of is something she was created with, and tasked to maintain in the world.

Zemetla
-------

   :Patronage: Dead people

   :Domains: Death, the afterlife

   :Personality and Details: As the goddess of death itself, and a constant reminder of life’s inevitable collapse, not many people would be happy to see her. However, everyone recognizes that, while her job is not the most desirable, her character makes up for it more than she needs. Of all the goddesses, Zemetla is the nicest and most polite, and only wishes that people die when they need to. As rewards to people who accept her embrace, but don’t rush to it, she gives their souls eternities of pleasure.

Notes on Ranthis
================

The group does not frequently interact with this set of {{aiɖi}}. Although Anket is part of the reason that they are not able to go back.

   Since hounds, specifically dogs, are seen as more submissive, and, furthermore, a submissive partner is sometimes commonly refered to as a *bitch*, I’m changing Skezna’s patronage as well as her race from Snakefolk to Houndfolk.

   Because of Skezna’s patronage’s change from Snakefolk to Houndfolk, Kvilkovoa’s patronage is changed from Houndfolk to Snakefolk.
