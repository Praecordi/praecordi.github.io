Minuit Oath [1]_
================


In the world of Rankvah, there exists a religious circle called the Minuit Oath, that worships, among the main pantheon, the act of having sex, and sexuality itself. Their literature is filled with tales of sexual plots and advice, from the sage who found a way to give herself strong orgasms without even touching her vagina, to the hunter who hadn’t yet recovered from an injury, yet was still able to go all-out with her several partners. Though the Minuit Oath are not, and do not wish to be, a governing entity anywhere, the parties they throw are almost always at their full capacity, and there is a constant demand for their literary works.

The Tale of the Power-Finding Sage

   A sage was experimenting with a very strong heat gem, but accidentally dropped it on her vagina. She got a painful burn, which was treated by her servant. The servant told the sage that, for the time being, she should not stimulate her vagina from the outside in any way, meaning no underwear, no masturbation, and no sex.

   Frustrated that she had to remain partially exposed in an unwanted area, and could not relieve herself of her sexual drives, she would spend hours just thinking about how much fun she’d have when her vagina finally heals. Neither kissing, nor breast fondling, nor anal fingering were enough for her, and she could not find anything that would pass the time easily.

   Eventually, the injury healed enough for the sage to return to her research and experiments, with only slight discomfort. She decided to experiment with anal probing with a smooth sexual aid. Surprised, she found that a certain point in her anus, beyond a finger’s reach, feels amazing when touched. She ordered her servant to assist her, and at that point the sage thought that she might’ve found a way to relieve sexual tension without needing her vagina. She couldn’t bring herself to order her servant to stop, and an hour later, the sage felt an orgasm coming, despite not having any stimulation on her vagina. She experienced an orgasm stronger than any orgasm she ever had. In what lasted for ten minutes, but felt like an eternity, she trembled, moaned loudly, and lost control of her bladder, all in pure bliss. After those ten minutes of being the first to experience this kind of pleasure, she couldn’t even stand up.

   Amazed at what she experienced, she wrote down everything, and spread what she knew. The sage’s name was Armit Ba’a, and this is how anal orgasms became known as “Armot”.

**Side Note 1**: Heat gems, the catalyst of this story are part of Rankvah’s magic system, about which you can read here.

**Side Note 2**: What the sage discovered was her prostate. In the world of Rankvah, all organisms are female, but their biology is slightly different from our-world females. A Rankvahn woman’s prostate is behind her bladder, which is why it’s unreachable with a finger, instead of under the bladder, where a finger can reach with little effort.
