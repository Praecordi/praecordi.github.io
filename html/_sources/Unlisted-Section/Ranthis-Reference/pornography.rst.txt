Pornography [1]_
================


Pornography in the world of Rankvah is legal and widely distributed. Film does not exist, and thus pornographic works exist as books, drawings, or plays. The Minuit Oath, a religious movement worshiping sexuality itself, include within them various writers, illustrators, and playwrights, whose works are always in demand. A store selling literary works by them, an art gallery featuring their art, or a theater troupe enacting their plays can get you very rich very quickly. From myths to legends to historical events, from vanilla to the extreme, the Minuit Oath has you covered.

While pornography is very widely accepted, there are various limitations. Published works are heavily regulated, and every published work abides the following norms:

-  **No animals involved in sexual activities.** After the introduction of the penis to humanity, humanity breeding with animals is no longer possible, and thus their inclusion both serves no purpose and insults the reader, viewer, or audience as people who throws away their humanity to live in the past. Demi-humans are allowed in published works without scrutiny, since they are considered to be “more human than animal”.
-  **No people below the age of 16 involved in sexual activities.** The legal age of consent is 14, but when it comes to pornography, the youngest age at which a person can publish sexual works, or appear in them, is 16. Furthermore, characters involved in sexual activities in any published work cannot, canonically to the work, be under the age of 16.
-  **No gore or purposeful serious physical harm.** Humans view their bodies as a gift from the Three Daughters (the world’s pantheon), and purposefully vandalizing it in any published work to that degree is strictly morally wrong and highly discouraged, not to mention the level of the act’s illegality by itself. Light whipping and spanking are allowed, but hitting, breaking bones, and causing bleeding are not allowed.
-  **No explicit lack of consent.** Society may glorify sex, but nobody is forced to experience it. Consent between two or more characters in a published literary work or play must be explicitly expressed. People in published art featuring sex are assumed to consent until told otherwise by the artist. Having sober sex with a drunk person, ignoring their denial of consent, or preventing them from expressing it, is seen as a terrible act and an insult to a relationship.
-  **No racist allusions or implications.** Racism is treated as a baseless insult, and is not tolerated by the general public. While not strictly illegal, most publishers deny works that feature racist stereotypes. Region-to-region stereotypes, or human to demi-human stereotypes, and vice versa, are not acceptable by the general public.

Unpublished works, mostly by people who just make them for fun, are not regulated, but are subject to public opinion. Proudly showing work that does not follow the norms will get you distanced and shunned by your community, though publishers will not care, as organizations, as long as you don’t come to them with that work.

Many people aspire to be able to make a living by writing, scripting, directing, acting in, or depicting sexual work, and to work under the Minuit Oath, but generations of great writers set the bar very high. The Minuit Oath are considered to exceed the general public by far, and achieving their recognition is an amazing achievement and a ticket to being filthy rich. Works can be republished with the sub-titled “Recognized by the Minuit Oath” to get their makers and the publishers a surge of money and popularity, though merchants will always double-check that each book, art piece, and script that claims to be recognized by the Minuit Oath is actually recognized.

People are encouraged to have side-jobs or hobbies that include making sexual works, so really anyone can start whenever they want. Many successful authors, artists, and playwrights started by just doing it as a hobby.

Due to the differences in the physiology of the average Rankvahn human and our-world female humans, there are several fetishes that can be considered exclusive to Rankvah, or at least more prominent there.

-  **Hermaphdorites.** Since the whole human population consists of hermaphroditical females, almost every person depicted is a hermaphrodite, meaning someone with both a penis and a vagina. In Rankvah, people with only a vagina or only a penis are considered abnormal.
-  **Tail play.** A Rankvahn Human has a patch of hair growth from their tailbone region. The hair can grow to beyond the length of a thigh. This hair is not a limb that can be moved, but none the less resembles a tail, and there are plenty of works that fetishize it.
-  **Gem play.** Rankvah has a magic system, which consists of special gem-like minerals that, by putting them through specific processes, can contain magical properties, like emitting heat, pulsing like vibrators, enhancing muscle strength, and more.
-  **Disorder play.** Rankvahn humans are prone to genetic or mutative sexual disorders, most of them included in sexual works due to their nature.

   -  Over-Extended Refractory Period (OERP) - Week-long refractory periods for both penile, vaginal, and prostate orgasms.
   -  Sexual Overfunction (SOF) - Constant arousal and randomly-occurring orgasms.
   -  Orgasmic Incapacitation (OIC) - Extreme and intense orgasms that render a person weak and unfocused for a while. In some cases, they render a person in a near-vegetative state for a few hours or days.
   -  Mid-Couse Muscular Hyperactivity (MCMH) - Muscle jerks that occur during sex or shortly after orgasm.
   -  Pheromone-Infused Secretions (PIS) - Constant emitting of sex pheromones, which cause arousal to another person who comes into contact with them for a certain duration.
   -  Subconscious Exhibitionist Behavior (SEB) - Sudden bouts of intense sexual urges, causing a person to reveal their body at random. Anyone who makes eye contact with someone experiencing a SEB episode is charmed and mentally compelled to have sex with that someone.
