The Afterlife and its Locations [1]_
====================================


The Afterlife
=============

When someone dies, their consciousness is immediately transferred to the afterlife. Specifically, to Zemetla’s court. Zemetla is the goddess of death and the afterlife. The afterlife itself is not a physical location but rather a cluster of consciousnesses, presented in a way that those inside it can comprehend.

First Impressions
=================

Let’s go through an experience to understand the afterlife well. You, an individual on Rankvah, died and are moving on to the afterlife. First, you’ll reach Zemetla’s Courts, but it just won’t feel real to you. That’s because your consciousness is kept at a dormant semi-dreaming state, so you’re still conscious of you surroundings, but cannot think straight. This is to ensure you don’t think of lies and excuses when you get judged. You see before you a representation of Zemetla (Not her true form, at least not yet), who will then ask you four questions before letting you through.

1. **“What have you done to satisfy your desires?”**

      This question’s purpose is to know your psychological grasp of sexuality, consent, and love itself. It’s to know whether or not you stayed faithful to your spouses, if you had any, as well as whether or not you disregarded someone’s lack of consent in your life.

      The punishment for not staying faithful is the inability to climax. Since you used your precious orgasms on (Or in) other people you were not married to, you’re not entitled to climax with anyone, not even your spouses.

      The punishment for disregarding someone’s lack of consent (Rape) is the plugging of all holes in your body, and removal of your genitals. It won’t hurt, but it would truly not be nice to potentially spend an eternity being unable to engage in sex, chat normally, or smell the flowers outside of Zemetla’s Courts.

2. **“Have you searched for a higher meaning?”**

      This question is meant to test your appreciation of knowledge; life experience, academic studies, and anything to do with learning is relevant. You will also answer regarding your attitude to them.

      The punishment for constant and active disregard of the pursuit of knowledge is inability to accurately recall your life before your death, and difficulty in achieving new knowledge in the afterlife.

3. **“How have you treated your fellows?”**

      This question tests your treatment of other humans and demi-humans, but also animals. Your carnivorous diet or job at a butchery will not influence the result negatively. Rather, the question refers to your treatment of other living things.

      The punishment for being rude for the sake of diminishing others is to enter the afterlife without the ability to communicate verbally.

      The punishment for repetitive violent acts for unjustified reasons is to enter the afterlife without your limbs.

4. **“Did you respect the world?”**

      This final question gives information of how you treated nature itself. This time, it’s not about “being nice to nature”, but about caring about nature, and knowing when to step back and let it do its own thing.

      The punishment for intervening with nature is not being given a personal place in the afterlife, so your soul will be forced to wander and be subject to the whims of the afterlife.

      You, being the wonder you are, pass all questions and are now recognized by Zemelta as worthy of a good afterlife. For each question answered sufficiently well, you get a “key”. These keys are used to access sub-realms inside the afterlife. Each of those realms are coated and filled with the essence of their representations.

The Realms
==========

The Realm of Love
-----------------

This realm is the best place for dead lovers to reunite. Breathing the air will fill you with love and passion, and embracing another person will feel hundreds of times better than it did in life. Where everything is beautiful, and the food is an aphrodisiac, public orgies are a frequent occurrence in the realm of love. Additionally, to reward your loyalty to your spouses, sex with them will be the peak of pleasure for you.

The Realm of Knowledge
----------------------

While not as attractive as the Realm of Love, the Realm of Knowledge offers something else. For those currently less interested in carnal pleasures and more on understanding the world they used to be in, this is the perfect place. Every book, scribble, and piece of knowledge is stored in pristine condition in the endless library that is the Realm of Knowledge. To reward your appreciation for the study of the world, you will be granted instant access to whatever you’d like to know, even while you’re outside of the realm.

The Realm of Kindness
---------------------

Sometimes called the “Realm of Love’s Little Sister”, the Realm of Kindness is a place where people can be themselves, and be nice to others. Sex and orgies can occur, but people mostly come there to enjoy the company of other worthy souls. If you ever want to take a break from sex and research, you can come over for a nice cup of tea and a good conversation. Access to the realm itself is a reward for being a good person.

The Realm of Naturalism
-----------------------

Now we get to the Realm of Naturalism, covered by wild landscapes. Oceans contained in ponds, grass fields where each blade is a tree, deserts of marbles, and many more things you would never be able to comprehend in life. Where nature itself roams free and unlimited, you can come and marvel at things you never saw before. No matter how long you stay, and no matter how much you explore, the realm will always have an infinite area you haven’t seen yet. The reward for appreciating nature and letting it do its thing is the ability to leave marks on the realm; shape some trees, move some rocks, cool down a river, and so on. This is one of the reasons why the realm never stays perfectly static.

Zemetla’s Courts
----------------

This does not get referred to as a realm, but counts anyways. The Courts are the only place that does not need a key to access. While not hideous or bad in any way, it does feel a bit restricted to only have access to the place where you got judged. Most of the souls there are one of three types: those being judged, those waiting for others to reunite with, and those who were unworthy of access to any other realms.

Personal Realms
===============

Since you’ve been good enough of a person to be worthy of access to all realms, you will also be rewarded with access to your own private realm.

While also potentially infinite in size, and fully controlled by their owners, most people who get a personal realm keep it very humble. A fishing hut on an island, a beach-side camp, or a farm house are common examples of the ways people use personal realms. For many, a simple life is a good one, and that also applies for them to the afterlife.

There are many people, however, who would like to leave the simplicity of life behind and live an afterlife of pure luxury; mansions with hundreds of rooms, fields of gold and gemstones, and much more.

People cannot enter the personal realm of another person without being invited first.

Finally, a personal realm’s owner can also create artificial souls inside the realm to provide for company. Those artificial souls are restricted to the personal realm and cannot leave, and can also be controlled freely by the realm’s owner.

Inherent Abilities
==================

Once you enter the afterlife, you’ll find that you can alter your appearance and physique to whatever you’d like. You could change your height and the color of your eyes, try to see what it’s like to be Snakefolk, increase your muscle mass, and so on. Despite this change of appearance, people will know who you are, since in the afterlife you’re recognized by your soul, not your body. It’s important to remember that bodily modifications you received as punishments cannot be worked around, though for a peak of goodness like you won’t need to worry about it.
