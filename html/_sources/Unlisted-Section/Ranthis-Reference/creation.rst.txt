Creation [1]_
=============


The world of Rankvah was created by the goddess Pheruksa. On the first year of the world, Pheruksa gave birth to two daughters, first the Land, and then the Sun. She then took the drops of her sweat and tears from birthing the twins, and piled them together into a third daughter, the Moon.

On the second year, she taught the three daughters about their sexuality, and the three daughters achieved their first climaxes. The Land was the first to climax, and her climax brought oceans and water on her. The Sun was the second to climax, and her climax spilled light over half of the Land’s body, which the Land couldn’t get off. The Moon was the third to climax, and her climax made the stars. Pheruska apologized to the daughters, and said that this was the only orgasm they are allowed to ever have, otherwise the entire world would fall into chaos.

On the third year, the Land asked the Sun to do something about the sunshine and the stars; the Land wanted her entire body to be heated by sunshine while always looking at the Moon’s beautiful stars. Unfortunately, the three daughters remembered that they were not allowed to climax once more on another side. Instead, they thought of a plan: the Sun would move herself and her sunshine around the surface of the Land every day, and the Moon would move herself and her stars around the other side of the surface not covered by sunshine.

On the fourth year, Pheruksa told her daughters that she wanted them to climax only once, so that she may populate the world with her own. She climaxed on the Land, and from that climax came all of the life on her. Plants and animals sprouted all over the land. The daughters looked at the plants and animals, and realized they had no way of bringing daughters. In an act of grace, they gave them the ability to make offspring by switching egg cells, which would be done by scissoring, and the egg cells would get fertilized by entering a new vagina.

On the fifth year, the three daughters looked at the world, and wanted to impress Pheruska with their own creation. They decided to make the animal that would be above all other animals: the woman. The Land made the body, the Sun made the soul, and the Moon made the mind. The three worked for an entire year, until they finally made something that almost rivaled their own beauty.

They showed their woman to Pheruksa, who praised their work and gave the woman gifts. For the body, she gave the woman breasts, to feed her daughters at any time. For the soul, she gave emotions, so the woman would enjoy the good of her life, but know to stay away from the bad. For the mind, she gave the knowledge of language and walking upright, to truly be above all animals. Pheruksa asked her daughters whether they’d want to make that woman the only kind of woman, but the daughters refused, saying that they want to see unique women with bodies, souls, and minds that they could never come up with. Pheruksa agreed, and changed the egg cells, so that no two women would be identical. She then made four more identical women, so that there was one woman on the world for each year the world was made, knowing that the generations to come would have many different women who would be a true pleasure to behold.

Notes on Ranthis
