Introducing the Penis [1]_
==========================


A New Organ
===========

As should be apparent from previous knowledge, the Three Daughters vastly adore the women they created over all other animals. They made them as the pinnacle, the animal to surpass all other animals, and gave them multiple gifts. Now, they wanted to separate the women from animals even more. For a long time, they thought of another give to give the women. Eventually, Pheruksa, the goddess and mother of the Three Daughters, offered to change how they create offspring. The Three Daughters immediately started thinking of different ways to do it.

First, they thought of moving the vagina to the back and the anus to the front, but that would not be very comfortable when you’ll need to relieve yourself. Then, they thought of allowing conception by fingering, but the chance for accidental conceptions would grow immensely. For their final attempt at it, they thought of a system so beautiful and poetic, yet indescribable in words, but realized that women were not perfect like them, and could not mate reliably that way.

Saddened and exhausted from the intense thinking, they gave up and asked Pheruksa for advice. Pheruksa, in her unlimited wisdom, suggested the following:

“All animals mate the same way; they place their vaginas next to each other, so they touch. Then, they stimulate themselves and each other, until an egg is passed by each one to the other. Instead of an interaction between vaginas, why not make an entirely new organ - an entirely new gift - that would place human mating above animal mating?”

The Three Daughters were inspired by their mother’s words, and immediately started thinking. Eventually, they came to a satisfying result, which they called a “Penis”. It would be a collection of three parts, and a change to another. First, the penis itself, which would rise and harden when its wielder is excited. Then, testicles, to act as holders for a new kind of fluid, which the Three Daughters named “semen”. Finally, the urethra of the penis - a hole in the middle, where the semen would come out of. Finally, they changed vaginas, so that egg cells were now immobile, and placed inside the womb. Instead of having to travel outside and search for an unfamiliar womb, they would wait inside the womb for semen to fertilize it.

After finishing their creation, they waited for the mortal women to be asleep. Then, they entered each woman’s dreams, and explained to her the new system. Additionally, they explained that every woman in the world, whether she’s an adult, child, or even baby, would be set to this new biology. From then, the world of Rankvah received its final biological separation between women and animals. A new mating system, a new organ, and a new future.
