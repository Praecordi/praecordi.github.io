Sexual Restrictions on Marriages [1]_
=====================================


Sex and Marriage
================

On Rankvah, getting married restricts your allowed actions in sex. While it doesn’t necessarily mean you’re not allowed to have sex with people you’re not married to, it does mean you and your partner’s secretions are not allowed to touch the other. Semen, breast milk, urine, or saliva is not allowed to be transferred from one married partner to another partner who isn’t married to her.

For this, people invented the Rankvahn equivalent of condoms. These can be penile condoms, vaginal condoms, oral condoms (Condoms that cover the mouth, so their user doesn’t transfer her saliva when not allowed), or breast condoms (Condoms that cover the breasts and nipples, so their user doesn’t lactate on a partner when not allowed). As for the design and look of oral condoms and breast condoms, I’ll leave them up to your imagination for now.

On the other hand, two partners who are both not married have no restriction on their fluids’ contact. Condoms are not required, and any contact of bodily fluids is allowed. The problem is courting someone you’re not married to; your friends may keep their zones clean until marriage, or just won’t be into it at the moment. This problem got many smart people thinking, and one came up with an answer that everyone happily adopted everywhere.

Orgy Halls
==========

Some people aren’t satisfied with their current partners, or maybe they just want to meet new potential partners. This brought the invention of the “Orgy Hall”; a building whose purpose is to allow for public sex, available for anyone. Entry is very cheap, and the halls are government-funded. Workers in the halls make their money from selling refreshments, accessories, gear, and toys to the participants, or from prostitution inside the hall. Anyone who gets paid to have sex inside an Orgy Hall is an employee there, and prostituting yourself inside a hall without being employed there is a serious offense.

Inside an Orgy Hall, anyone is allowed to have sex with anyone else (That consents, obviously). Those who come to an Orgy Hall can be really anyone. Unmarried people come to have sex, chat with others, and find potential lovers inside. It’s very socially acceptable to say that you met the love of your life in an Orgy Hall.

Additionally, Orgy Halls usually come with private rooms, just in case two or more people wanted some privacy, or a participant wanted a more quiet place to enjoy a prostitute. To use a room, one must pay an amount of money that is largely proportional to the amount of time they plan to spend there. Obviously, the price is slightly raised, so the employees can make some money. At the end of the day, an Orgy Hall is a social place to meet new people, have a good time, and maybe even get some rest. Many halls would allow you to also stay the night, as long as you can pay for it.
