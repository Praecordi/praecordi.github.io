===============================
Technology and Occupations [1]_
===============================


Rankvahn technology is, at least to us, fairly archaic, but they also have a few innovations of their own that are not possible in our world due to inherent differences.

For an easy way to compare between their level and our level, I’ll go with the mass-produced writing I was talking about. Rankvahn humans have not yet gotten to the level of the printing press, but they have achieved the previous iteration in our real-world history of print: the Movable Type. It’s a system similar to the printing press, though it came 400 years before it. While the idea is the same, the mechanic is different; imagine the idea behind a printing press, but without the physical printing press. You would have a block of letters, which you can arrange in any way you’d like, then you cover them with ink and press a medium on it. The ink transfers to the medium as letters. On Rankvah, this is a luxurious form of print, and the common people need to write their letters, books, or scripts by hand.

As for the last question, I think you meant demi-humans. Demi-humans are socially integrated into society seamlessly, though their job options are slightly more specialized.

Beastfolk Occupations
=====================

The body and build of Beastfolk allow them to pursue careers that depend on speed or strength. Those jobs include transportation of goods or people, or serving as guards or knights.

Small note about Beastfolk transportation: A person riding on a Beastfolk is seen as a very intimate act, so the overwhelming majority of them would object to having anyone ride on their back, aside from their family.

Birdfolk Occupations
====================

Due to the differences in physiques, Birdfolk have very limited race-specific jobs. Usually, they work for search parties or delivering mail. They don’t carry the mail in their mouths or feet, but instead wear multiple pouches, each containing plenty of letters.

Catfolk Occupations
===================

Catfolk possess enhanced senses, and are highly dexterous, which lets them serve jobs that need these skills. They can easily outclass normal humans when it comes to scouting, spying, or committing crimes.

Houndfolk Occupations
=====================

Houndfolk also possess enhanced senses, but have more stamina instead of dexterity. Their job options usually go for search parties, detectives, or guards.

Dragonfolk Occupations
======================

Dragonfolk are, in the words of society itself, very intelligent, with their mental capacity highly outranking normal humans and demi-humans. Many Dragonfolk pursue academic professions, like teaching, politics, and science. It’s not uncommon to see a Dragonfolk teacher in your school.

Snakefolk Occupations
=====================

While other demi-humans have jobs tailored for their bodies, Snakefolk don’t enjoy these benefits. Their peak speed is no faster than a normal human’s jog, their tails take plenty of space, and their only saving grace is better night vision. These disadvantages are what sometimes gets people to consider them as disabled. Due to those limitations, a noticeable portion of Snakefolk serve as housewives.
