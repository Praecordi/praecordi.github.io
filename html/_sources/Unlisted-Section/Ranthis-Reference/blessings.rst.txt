Blessings of the Decade’s Start [1]_
====================================

How to Get Blessed
==================

The first day of the year is a special day, for obvious reasons. In Rankvah, there’s another reason why that day is special: during that day, anyone human or demi-human has a chance of being born with a Blessing. Said chance is so low that there’s no accurate measure of it, but it’s definitely not reliable. A Blessing, in short, is an extraordinary difference in the physique of one’s body that can be traced to a natural entity. Those with Blessings may count as a superior species in certain Rankvahn subcultures, and for no small reason. Blessed people are born with superhuman physical qualities, which makes them a cut above the rest in physicality. There are also those born with multiple Blessings, something said to occur once in decades, even centuries. People with more than one Blessing are revered as part-divine, and they will be worshiped in almost the same capacity as the actual pantheon, though not more. The same Blessing can also be enhanced, depending on the person’s race. For example, the Blessing of the Cow has an additional effect if the person in question is a Horse-type Beastfolk.

    The Blessed constantly excretes clean water from her orifices, especially from her mouth, eyes, and genitals. This does not dehydrate the Blessed. The water has medicinal properties.

Blessing of the Snow

The Blessed’s skin is white, and her body temperature is below average. She can handle cold environments easily.

*Note: Rankvahn people are dark-skinned.*

Blessing of the Spider
----------------------

The Blessed has six additional eyes; a pair above the eyebrows, a pair below the “normal” eyes, a pair to the “normal eyes”’ side, and a pair above and to the outside of the eyebrows.

Additionally, if the Blessed is a Beastfolk, their lower body will be that of a spider instead of any other type it would’ve had.

Blessing of the Sun
-------------------

The Blessed’s body temperature is above average. This also causes her to be less prone to disease, but weakens her immune system in return.

Blessing of the Tree
--------------------

The Blessed’s muscle tissue is much more solid than average. Additionally, the Blessed’s hair resembles leaves.
