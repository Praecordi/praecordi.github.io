Focus on Hospitality
====================

In Rankvahn society, hospitality is a very prominent part of daily life. Be it a shopkeeper welcoming you to her shop, or even just your friend who invited you over on a whim, you will always be given the best experience the host could give, though the quality would vary depending on the host. As you’d expect, a hotel’s staff would be more suited to give you a pleasant experience than your working-class friend, but both would be just as enthusiastic.

Good hospitality not only makes a good first impression, but is also full of hints regarding your stay, that many people learn not from being told about them, but from experiencing them and understanding the patterns. While each place and person vary in their presentation, each and every hospitable place or person would serve you hot tea. Regardless of the tea’s temperature, people will do one of the following things to show their opinion of the relationship:

-  Blowing on the tea, then drinking it, to acknowledge your relationship. The less you blow, the more intimate the relationship is. Your coworkers and neighbors will usually blow for around two to four solid seconds, while your relatives will only blow for a second or so.
-  Drinking the tea without blowing, to accentuate the relationship’s intimacy. If the host is your fiancee, or your husband or wife, you should do this without a second thought.
-  Not blowing on the tea, drinking the tea at all, or even holding the cup. If they do so, they do not like you at all and don’t mind appearing very visibly rude.

Additionally, the amount of tea poured into the cup will show the guest how long the host wants the visit to be. In short, more is less, and less is more.

-  About halfway: The host appreciates your company.
-  Filled to the brim: The host wants you to finish your business quickly, usually due to being preoccupied with something urgent, but sometimes because the host doesn’t mind appearing rude.
-  Barely filled: The host wants you to ask for as many refills as you can, so you may stay much longer.

After the drinking, the host will do her absolute best to ensure that your visit is the best she can offer. If you eat there, the host will serve her best dish on her best kitchenware. If you bathe there, the host will offer to wash your body. If you sleep there, the host will offer her own bed and sleep on a mattress. If you want to have sex, the host will give full control to you over what happens in bed (If asked).

Visitors from Other Lands
=========================

If a Rankvahn gets the utmost honor and pleasure of hosting a person from another country, the level of hospitality skyrockets. If she has the opportunity to host someone from another world, people from all around the village or city would also offer to host the visitor at their place, and by consequence the local lords would notice. After that, maybe even the governor of the country would take interest. In that case, expect only the best of the best in terms of hospitality, and maybe some requests for other-worldly advice.

It’s also possible, and very probable, for an other-worlder to get the attention of a goddess. If you enter the world through her domain, or encounter one of her active worshippers, chances are a divine governor of part of the world would take interest, and invite you to a very warm welcome that only a goddess could provide. In that case, you can enjoy the hospitality of a :doc:`goddess <the-full-pantheon>`, potentially followed by the hospitality of an entire pantheon that took interest. Whatever you tell them about your world, they will listen, remember every detail, and love every tangent. Ask them anything, and they will race to be the first to answer. Ask to have anything, and they might as well line up and present their best offering.

**Side note**: Some people may notice that the intricacies of tea procedures are somewhat similar to those of Arab cultures. As someone who has plenty of Arab friends, and visited plenty of Arab houses, I couldn’t help but admire their commitment to good hospitality, and decided to add in some of their aspects to Rankvahn culture.

**A few points about sex with your guest**: If the host and the guest are not related by marriage, and at least one of them is married, they may still have sex, but they are not allowed to let their semen touch any part of them directly, since it’s seen as a violation of a person’s marriage. For this, the host will provide the Rankvahn equivalent of condoms. As for how they look, for now I’ll let you use your imagination. If both the host and the guest are married to each other, or neither of you are married, ejaculation is not forbidden, and condoms are optional.
