Public Nudity and Sex [1]_
==========================


In Rankvahn society, sexuality is not kept secret from anyone. The average Rankvahn teenager knows more than the average high-schooler would know about sex from their sex-ed classes (Provided they were taught at the expected level not influenced by religion or upbringing).

Nudism is not necessarily encouraged, but also never discouraged. If anything, the common person would think of clothes as a way to maintain body temperature, and would augment their appearance with accessories. On hot days, it’s perfectly normal to walk around in your birthday suit. Additionally, many nobles have elaborate clothes that draw your eyes to exposed skin and erogenous zones, and showcase their pride in their body by walking outside with said exposing clothes.

As for public sex, the act is treated as a way for two or more people to express their intimacy publicly. Public sex can usually be seen from midday to evening twilight, when it’s relatively warm outside. Many who come to watch sexual theater plays end up having sex with their partners, or at least masturbating, during the play, though they generally need to at least not interrupt the rest of the audience to not be shushed.

The topic of sex is very liberal, and children are often taught about sex as they reach their teens - how to have safe sex, how to handle an unexpected pregnancy, and so on. The age of consent is 14, so the impressionable years before reaching it are spent learning about the things that could make or break their lives or marriage.
