Agriculture and Dietary Practices [1]_
======================================


Food in General
===============

The world of Rankvah (Roll credits), being made by magic and filled with magical gems, is constantly emitting magical energy that is absorbed into every organism. Additionally, the world is very rich in “oxygen”, which lets many of the organisms to be as massive as they are. This means most of the fruit and animals can reach dimensions that would be considered absurd in our world. Imagine something that looks like a melon but is as large as a watermelon. That ratio is very rough, but it checks out most of the time.

Edible Plantation
=================

Rankvahn agriculture is similar to our-world agriculture, though its some specific produces are different. There are types of produce that don’t exist in Rankvah, and some that are exclusive to it. In short, Rankvahn agriculture has grain, sweet fruits, vegetables, bulbous plants, and spices like in our world. Additionally, Rankvah has mushrooms, all of which are edible. Exclusive to Rankvah are watermelon-sized fruit with a hard shell and soft, almost goo-like insides.

Domesticated Animals
====================

Despite to demi-humans’ existence, people don’t find a problem domesticating any animal that allows it. Although uncommon, you could see Horse-type Beastfolk raising horses, or Houndfolk herding sheep with shepherd wolves. This is because demi-humans see themselves as separate from animals.

Edible Secretions
=================

Some Rankvahn species can produce edible secretions from their body. This can range from the obvious cow milk to other, more niche secretions. Cow-type Beastfolk produce very thick breast milk with a strong, sweet flavor, that is considered a delight in many places. Many Cow-type Beastfolk sometimes contribute their excess milk to restaurants for quick money. Additionally, the base flavor of Rankvahn semen is much less offensive than our-world semen, and Dragonfolk truly make that apparent, with semen that has a faint vanilla-like taste. Their distilled saliva is also considered a luxury, and only the most high-class restaurants can proudly serve genuine thrice-distilled Dragonfolk saliva, which becomes intoxicating just when twice-distilled.

Restaurants
===========

Each city has plenty of restaurants specializing in certain kinds of dishes. One restaurant could serve you feasts of meat, while the one across the street could send you to a dairy sugar rush. Whatever kind of food you want to enjoy, any city would have what you’re looking for. In small villages, though there aren’t many restaurants, there will be taverns, public dining halls, or just plain bars.
