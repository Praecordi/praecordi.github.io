    :icon: clock
    
    These societies are the bases of the holds which will share the cultures of the Pre-Arrival societies. There are 8 planned holds: 
    
    - 1 ruled by `θisœʈe`
    - 3 ruled by the daughters of `eɹaʈɛ` (`seθi`, `aʃaða`, and `teʃi`)
    - 2 ruled by the daughters of `saiʃeʈa` (`dea` and `θea`)
    - Later, 1 hold is added which is ruled by the 5 daughters of `ajɛseɖi` and `stɹai` (commonly called the `ʃɛʈaie`)
    - 1 is added which is ruled by `iɖe` who is the daughter of `θisœʈe` and `stɹai` (but `θisœʈe` does not make this publicly known). 
    
    After `iɖe` rebels against `ajɛseɖi`, and unites with `saiʃeʈa` into her own separate confederacy, more holds into both `ajɛseɖi` and `saeθa`'s confederacy as well as `iɖe` and `saiʃeʈa`'s confederacy. Namely, there are 6 more holds added:
    
    - 1 for `siydi`, daughter of `aʃaða` and `θea`
    - 1 for `sjeði`, daughter of `teʃi` and `dea`
    - 1 for `ase`, adopted by `iɖe`
    - 1 for `sœʈi`, daughter of `aðia` and `iɖe` (sister of `sia`)
    - 1 for `ʈaʃe`, daughter of `iɖe` and `seθi`
    - 1 for `ʈɛe`, daughter of `iɖe` and `dea`
    
    `iɖe`'s old hold is inherited by her favorite daughter `sia`.
    
    Which hold's culture is based upon which Pre-Arrival society is dependent on their geographic location and will be decided upon later.

.. dropdown:: On Hold Doctrines
    :icon: clock

    Doctrines are an important part of holds, as because of the clothing-based magic system, more popular than the energy-based magic system due to its rarity, caused clothing to be an important part of cultures across `aɖasi`. While most every day people couldn't perform this magic because of the lack of resources required, people adopted the tradition of wearing clothing similar to the magicians they followed or were in allegiance to. Rulers would wear the clothings similar to those in legends as a way to consolidate their rule. 
    
    When the `isiʈeθɶ` and `zœeɖaʃi` were installed as rulers of `aɖasi`, they adopted a similar system. The Hold Doctrines, as they are called, are a cascading system of doctrines of which areas of the body an outfit should keep covered or uncovered, as well as the type of material the clothing should be made of. These doctrines are an important ceremonial tradition maintained by the `isiʈeθɶ` and `zœeɖaʃi`. 
    
    During the Great Split, the turning of `saiʃeʈa` was indicated through her change in clothing which followed a different doctrine. `teʃi` also changed the doctrine of her hold to follow that of her mentor. When `θea` switched over to `saeθa`, she adopted a doctrine following that of `saeθa`. `iɖe`, when creating a new coalition after the Great Split, created a doctrine that followed her inspiration, `θisœʈe`. 
    
    .. rubric:: Rules of the Doctrines
    
    The body is divided into 4 parts: the top, arms, middle and bottom. The top consists of the shoulders and chest. Then there are the arms. The middle consists of the stomach and extends past the waist to the hips. The bottom consists of the hips and the legs.

    Each part is divided into its left and right side. Furthermore, the top and bottom are divided into smaller parts: the upper and the lower. The upper top consists of the parts between the neck and the breasts. The lower top consists primarily of the breasts, and may include some areas below the breasts but are not required to. The upper bottom primarily includes the waist to the crotch, and may include the thighs but are not required to. The lower bottom includes the lower legs, including the knee.

    In total, the body is thus divided into 12 different parts:

    #. upper left top
    #. upper right top
    #. lower left top
    #. lower right top
    #. left arm
    #. right arm
    #. left middle
    #. right middle
    #. upper left bottom
    #. upper right bottom
    #. lower left bottom
    #. lower right bottom

        .. tab-item:: Doctrines before the Great Split

            The only coalition during this time is the `ateɹti` coalition (this name was only given after the Great Split). Since before the Arrival, an exposed waist was considered a warrior's outfit (since combat `sʋe` requires an exposed waist). This doctrine was kept in wartime during Arrival and stuck around as a ceremony afterwards.

            Besides this coalition wide rule, there are local rules for each hold, a remnant of the hold system found in many cultures on `aɖasi`. And each `zœeɖaʃi`, including the `isiʈeθɶ` themselves, will have their own rule for their claim, which dictates the type of clothing worn by the nobles in official events.
