`etiaʃi`
^^^^^^^^

.. admonition:: Summary

    :Title: `aiɖi` of `ajesɹɶ eʒɶsjɛ` (Goddess of Physical Beauty)
    :Patronage: Transfiguration

`etiaʃi` is the `aiɖi` of `ajesɹɶ eʒɶsjɛ`, physical beauty. Due to the paramount importance of beauty, particularly in its physical manifestation, `etiaʃi` stands as the most revered deity on `zai`. Her patronage primarily extends to the devoted `isʋe` who specialize in Transfiguration, thus emphasizing her connection to physical appearance. She is the elder sister of `aʃieti`.

In any realm, the `aiɖi` herself possesses unparalleled beauty. Her presence captivates onlookers, making it challenging to precisely delineate her features, yet one can immediately grasp a general impression of her enchanting persona. `etiaʃi` assumes a form that closely resembles that of a human female. Often described as athletically proportioned, her physique emanates both strength and grace. Smooth and firm breasts harmonize with a delicate, slender waist, while robust hips and legs contribute to her powerful stride, causing her long hair to sway in a mesmerizing rhythm. Geometric lines adorning her breasts and stomach emit an intriguing dark luminescence, seemingly absorbing light.

Encounters with `etiaʃi` leave most observers in a state of awe, as if in the presence of something divine. They report experiencing profound relaxation and a transformative effect on their own bodies, ignited by a primal urge awakened within them. Witnesses attest that the physical improvement is also evident in the company of others during such encounters, although those not present during these visits often remain unaware of these effects. When `etiaʃi` speaks, her voice exudes a soft and inviting allure, compelling listeners to lean closer, enticed by her heavenly, corporeal essence. Her commanding tone can stir a profound desire to fulfill her every wish.

A firsthand account by `ajɛseɖi`, an individual deeply connected to `etiaʃi` and a frequent visitor, portrays the `aiɖi` as dignified and idealistic, to the point of seemingly defying reality. Possessiveness characterizes her nature, as she goes to great lengths to retain both objects and individuals she acquires. As befitting an `aiɖi` of Beauty, she possesses an insatiable libido, engaging in numerous intimate encounters with `ajɛseɖi` during their courtship, reportedly seven times daily, attesting to their profound connection.

The alluring presence and captivating aura of `etiaʃi`, combined with her defining traits and ethereal allure, establish her as an unparalleled figure within the realm of `ajesɹɶ eʒɶsjɛ` and solidify her position as the embodiment of physical beauty on `zai`.

`aʃieti`
^^^^^^^^

.. admonition:: Summary

    :Title: `aiɖi` of `ajesɹɶ øʃasjɛ` (Goddess of Spiritual/Inner Beauty)
    :Patronage: Transfiguration

`aʃieti` is the `aiɖi` of `ajesɹɶ øʃasjɛ` (spiritual beauty). Given the paramount importance of beauty within the realm of `zai`, coupled with her status as the younger sister of `etiaʃi`, `aʃieti` emerges as one of the most revered deities in the `zai` pantheon. Her primary patronage is directed towards `isʋe` devoted to Transfiguration, although her services are occasionally sought for Alteration `sʋease`.

In many aspects, `aʃieti` bears similarities to and yet represents a polar opposite of `etiaʃi`. While her beauty remains renowned even among the `aiɖi`, it pales in comparison to that of `etiaʃi`. `aʃieti` assumes a physical appearance that exudes youthfulness. Though observers struggle to precisely articulate her features, they can provide a rough approximation of her persona. She manifests in a form that closely resembles that of a young human female, characterized by a petite stature, smaller breasts, and slender hips. Despite her perceived smallness and youthfulness, she emits an air of maturity. Like `etiaʃi`, geometric lines adorning her breasts and stomach emit a radiant white light. In contrast to `etiaʃi`, `aʃieti` typically appears clothed, often donning traditional attire reflective of the caller's culture, yet frequently adorned in a soft, sleeveless midriff top and a slim, floor-length skirt. On rare occasions, `aʃieti` reveals her body, typically upon a firm request from an `isʋe` or as a reward.

Individuals who have encountered the `aiɖi` describe her as a gentle and nurturing spirit. Similar to the experience with `etiaʃi`, they report a profound sense of relaxation and contentment. Many attest to the complete dissipation of stress and negative emotions, replaced by a surge of pure energy. When `aʃieti` speaks, her voice emanates a soft and caring tone, brimming with empathy and passion. Notably, meeting `aʃieti` proves considerably more challenging compared to encountering other `aiɖi`, including her sister `etiaʃi`.

According to a secondary account relayed by `ajɛseɖi`, `etiaʃi` mentions that her sister can be somewhat demanding and inflexible, imposing regimented requirements on her followers. Conversely, `etiaʃi` acknowledges that `aʃieti` displays a certain level of naivety, often entangling herself in the intricacies of inter-deity politics. `ajɛseɖi` herself observes that both sisters share an idealistic nature, bordering on the unrealistic, regarding their expectations. However, `ajɛseɖi` also notes that `aʃieti`'s requirements primarily revolve around the well-being and inner peace of her followers, ultimately seeking to enhance their personal beauty.

`iʈʂedy`
^^^^^^^^

.. admonition:: Summary

    :Title: `aiɖi` of `itʒje` (Goddess of Time)
    :Patronage: Divination

`iʈʂedy` is the `aiɖi` of `itʒje` (time). Unsurprisingly, she holds a central position in the hierarchy of revered deities due to her dominion over temporal matters. Owing to her formidable power and profound knowledge of time, she serves as the primary patron of Divination `isʋe`. `iʈʂedy` assumes the role of the elder sibling to `iɖʐe`.

Among all the `aiɖi`, `iʈʂedy` stands as the eldest. Despite her frail and wiry frame, which sharply contrasts with the physique of `iɖʐe`, her face possesses an elongated and slender appearance. Those who encounter her often remark on her evasive gaze, as if she were timid. In reality, `iʈʂedy`'s eyes perpetually wander, absorbing the intricacies of her surroundings. Like her sister, she takes the form of a human female, although it remains largely unknown to the majority that she possesses a retractable penis, typically concealed within her form. However, `iʈʂedy` employs this additional organ far less frequently than her sister, if its presence is even noticeable. Accounts concerning `iʈʂedy`'s penis consistently describe it as flaccid, although it should be noted that only a few individuals have claimed to have witnessed it. Despite her slender and delicate build, she possesses surprisingly ample breasts, albeit smaller in comparison to other `aiɖi` such as `etiaʃi` or `θaœ`. One consistent aspect in each sighting of `iʈʂedy` is the irregularity of her attire. Some have reported her appearing in disheveled garments, while others note instances where she appeared partially clothed, or more frequently, completely naked.

Contrary to the initial impression of shyness, `iʈʂedy`'s behavior more accurately aligns with hyperactivity. She transitions swiftly from one task to another without much contemplation, constantly preoccupied with the next endeavor. The perception of shyness is further compounded by her occasional moodiness or apparent indifference and neglectful demeanor. She is renowned for her resolute nature and adherence to principles, often declining requests that exhibit inconsiderate, imprudent, or irrational attributes.

Both `saiʃeʈa` and `saeθa` concur that `iʈʂedy` is highly stubborn. She possesses a tendency to enter a dreamy and contemplative state, seemingly detached from external stimuli. `saeθa` humorously recounts instances during their mating sessions where `iʈʂedy` lost interest or desire midway through pleasuring `saeθa`. However, alongside her moodiness, both `isiʈeθɶ` affirm that `iʈʂedy` exemplifies an exceptional level of reliability and dutifulness, consistently fulfilling her obligations and tasks, provided one can persuade her to accept the assignment or directive.

`iɖʐe`
^^^^^^

.. admonition:: Summary
    
    :Title: `aiɖi` of `zai` (Goddess of Sun)
    :Patronage: Combat

`iɖʐe` is the `aiɖi` of `zai`, sun. `Iɖʐe` is the `aiɖi` associated with `zai`, the sun. She holds the position of the younger sibling to `iʈʂedy`. Her authority over the sun establishes her as the primary patron of Combat `isʋe`.

`Iɖʐe` embodies an imposing figure among the `aiɖi`. Her physique is characterized by a substantial and remarkably muscular build. Her countenance emanates a radiant luminosity, imbued with an unfathomable brilliance, while perpetually retaining an introspective composure. In alignment with the general form observed in other `aiɖi`, she assumes an appearance closely resembling that of a human female. Similar to her sister `iʈʂedy`, she possesses a retractable penis, although her typical form features a vagina. Despite having given birth to a solitary `aiɖi`, `iɖʐe` has fathered numerous mortal beings. Corresponding to the robustness exhibited throughout her physique, her penis is broad and muscular. In comparison to other `aiɖi`, her breasts are relatively smaller, yet distinct and aesthetically pleasing. `Iɖʐe` consistently presents herself attired, adhering to a conservative and regimented style. She habitually dons her customary sleeveless red shirt, complemented by a flowing warrior's skirt. Dual long swords, slightly curved at the tips, are secured to her belt, accompanied by a crimson cloth affixed to their hilts.

Testimonials from those who have encountered the `aiɖi` frequently depict her as an intimidating presence. Preconceived notions often anticipate `iɖʐe` to be incessantly wrathful and destructive. Consequently, observers are surprised to encounter a composed, contemplative, and orderly deity. Rather than inciting impulses of destruction and devastation, witnesses frequently describe an overwhelming sense of tranquility and restraint, as if their internal turmoil has been quelled. `Iɖʐe` possesses a commanding voice, both forceful and composed, akin to a leader issuing orders to her subordinates. She exhibits a remarkable degree of resourcefulness and ingenuity, as reported by many.

According to `saeθa`, their grandmother-in-law proves to be an exceedingly vibrant and dynamic personality once one becomes acquainted with her. She embodies a refreshing authenticity and lacks pretense. Conversely, `iɖʐe` exhibits a notable susceptibility to gullibility and impulsive behavior, constantly driven by a yearning for action and direction. `Saiʃeʈa` observes that in the absence of a designated mission or goal, `iɖʐe` ventures into pursuits of personal pleasure, often entailing either combat or seeking gratification. Regrettably, such endeavors seldom conclude favorably for the opposing party.

`ʂiɹiø`
^^^^^^^

.. admonition:: Summary
    
    :Title: `aiɖi` of `ʋy` (Goddess of Nature)
    :Patronage: Elemental & Divination

`ʂiɹiø` is the `aiɖi` of `ʋy`, true nature. She bears the distinction of being the mother of `ɹyθiɛ`, conceived by an unknown mortal or `aiɖi`. Given her dominion over nature and the inner self, she serves as the primary patron for Elemental and Divination `isʋe`.

As the eldest among the foreign `aiɖi`, `ʂiɹiø` possesses a distinct appearance that sets her apart from her counterparts. She bears no resemblance to any `ʈeaθyɖa`, `astɹœ`, or `aʋjasi`. Instead, she frequently manifests as a nebulous mist devoid of a discernible form. In her communication, she eschews physical sound waves, conveying her thoughts through a stream of images and emotions. Only during the act of mating does she assume a physical form, compelled by the circumstances. Due to her inherent nature as the `aiɖi` of Nature, when necessitated to adopt a physical manifestation for specific tasks or interactions, she automatically assumes the likeness of the individual involved.

The fortunate few who have witnessed or experienced her presence describe `ʂiɹiø` as a warm and patient spirit. Possessing profound clairvoyance, she comprehends a vast array of potential futures, rendering her speech an invaluable source of insight into one's own self and forthcoming events.

Accounts from those acquainted with her character assert that she is remarkably forgetful and prone to instability. Given her profound comprehension of diverse future possibilities, she may exhibit considerable indecisiveness. Nevertheless, her sedentary disposition renders her relatively easy to locate.

`eʋʈi`
^^^^^^

.. admonition:: Summary

    :Title: `aiɖi` of `sai` (Goddess of the Night)
    :Patronage: Conjuration

`eʋʈi` is the `aiɖi` of `sai`, the night. She stands as the older sibling of `zɛɹa` and one of the four foreign `aiɖi`. Diverging from her fellow deities, she has chosen to become the patron of Conjuration `isʋe`. Consequently, Conjuration is closely intertwined with the concept of the night, as she garners the highest reverence among practitioners seeking mastery in Conjuration `sʋe`.

Among the newly recognized `aiɖi`, `eʋʈi` is most readily characterized as the epitome of angelic and ethereal beauty, rivaling even `etiaʃi` in allure. In contrast to the ever-shifting beauty perceived by onlookers in `etiaʃi`, `eʋʈi` manifests in a single, resplendent form. Possessing jet-black skin and radiant white eyes and teeth, she frequently appears in her natural state, unclad. On rare occasions when she adorns herself, she dons a white gown. Her obsidian hair cascades gracefully over her shoulders, each swaying strand regarded as a harmonious melody to the ears of `ʈeaθyɖa`. Her delicate breasts boast pale pink, almost white nipples, while the intimate recesses of her tightly enveloping vagina reveal a similar coloration. Her strength emanates from a combination of grace and a profound, penetrating gaze. She speaks sparingly, her voice resounding with deliberate cadence and an ancient resonance.

Testimonies from those who have encountered her voice attest to its irresistible allure, gently coaxing listeners toward her, akin to a descent into a boundless void. Embracing her is reported to induce ultimate relaxation, as though a wave of lethargy washes over individuals, lulling them into slumber. Yet, her frigid kiss abruptly rouses them from their stupor, freezing them in alertness.

Acquaintances of `eʋʈi` describe her as a commanding presence with flamboyant mannerisms. She possesses an insatiable craving for excellence, whether in relation to individuals or possessions. Such single-minded fixation may lead some to view her as predatory. Nevertheless, she emerges as the most dependable among the `aiɖi` in certain respects, despite her perceived scheming nature.

`zɛɹa`
^^^^^^

.. admonition:: Summary

    :Title: `aiɖi` of `yɹʋœ` (Goddess of the Moons)
    :Patronage: Animation & Necromancy

`zɛɹa` is the `aiɖi` of `yɹʋœase`, the diverse moons of `zai`. As the younger sister of `eʋʈi` and one of the four foreign `aiɖi`, she holds a distinctive position within the celestial hierarchy. Notably, `zɛɹa` functions as the patron of Animation and Necromancy `isʋe`, embodying the essence of these domains.

While bearing a resemblance to her sister in terms of appearance, `zɛɹa` exhibits a stark contrast in personality. Just as angelic as her sister, she manifests herself in a singular, mesmerizing form. However, `zɛɹa` possesses distinct physical characteristics. Her pale white skin emits an ethereal glow, diverging from her sister's jet-black complexion. Adorned with eyes tinged in a light purple hue and curly white hair, often styled in intricate rolls, `zɛɹa` dons rough dark attire that conceals her ample bosom. Furthermore, her vaginal region, while lighter in color than her sister's, displays a purplish tint rather than the customary pink. Notably, `zɛɹa` possesses a retractable penis in place of her vagina, a feature distinct to her foreign nature. This appendage deviates from the norm observed among the other `aiɖi` of this world, characterized by a fleshy glans of matching color to her vaginal flesh, enclosed within a thick, ridged skin that envelops the shaft. Undulating openings along the underside of the shaft expose erogenous inner tissue. It is worth mentioning that `zɛɹa` possesses a conventionally beautiful vagina when this unusual appendage remains concealed. In contrast to her sister's intense and direct gaze, `zɛɹa` portrays distant and contemplative eyes, while her gentle features seem perpetually immersed in profound contemplation.

Diverging from the soft and encouraging nature of her sister, `zɛɹa` embodies a timid disposition. She demonstrates a protective instinct towards her followers and is easily impressed. In essence, she epitomizes a benevolent and supportive `aiɖi`, renowned for her willingness to collaborate with mortals and other `aiɖi` alike. It is primarily due to her docile and nurturing demeanor that she became imprisoned by the Moon Dynasty, whose rulers exploited her timid nature to establish a lineage of powerful demi-`aiɖi` empresses and ultimately the `ʒiɹtɶ`. It is important to note that while `zɛɹa` tends to be gentle, timid, and slow to anger, her formidable power and capacity for destruction match that of any `aiɖi` when provoked. Consequently, her unleashed fury becomes all the more perilous, underscoring the gravity of her wrath.

`ɹyθiɛ`
^^^^^^^

.. admonition:: Summary
    
    :Title: `aiɖi` of `ɹyθɛy` (Goddess of Destruction)
    :Patronage: Combat

`ɹyθiɛ` is the `aiɖi` of `ɹyθɛy`, destruction. She stands as the daughter of `ʂiɹiø`, conceived through an unknown mortal or `aiɖi`. As the `aiɖi` of destruction, she claims the position of primary patron of Combat `isʋe`.

Diverging from her mother in terms of appearance, `ɹyθiɛ` possesses a commanding stature characterized by substantial muscularity, indicative of meticulousness. Her presence is typically accompanied by tailored attire, carefully selected to reflect the audience she engages with. Each movement and action she undertakes is calculated and executed with precision. Her mannerisms and garments adhere to a methodical, pristine, and regular standard, exuding an air of grooming and preparedness. Furthermore, her articulation is clear, while her vigilant eyes penetrate one's very soul, assessing the most effective means of obliterating not only the physical self but also the mental, emotional, and spiritual realms.

`ɹyθiɛ` innately embodies a destructive nature, employing cunning and deception to fulfill her pursuits. Revered as a skilled tormentor and an inventive warrior, she continually devises novel methods of inflicting pain and suffering, surpassing previous thresholds of agony. Surprisingly, however, she remains accessible, readily appearing before her most devout followers. Her prominence primarily arises during times of war, commanding the adoration of countless warriors who diligently study her ways. Advocating for a strategic approach to killing, she prioritizes maximum devastation while conserving energy expenditure.

`seʃɹø`
^^^^^^^

.. admonition:: Summary
    
    :Title: `aiɖi` of `itʃi` (Goddess of Creation)
    :Patronage: (Conjuration & Animation)

`seʃɹø` is the `aiɖi` of `itʃi`, creation. Unsurprisingly, she stands as a deity of paramount veneration due to her commanding power. As the patron of Conjuration and Divination `isʋe`, `seʃɹø` wields her creative abilities with great influence. She manifests as the offspring of `aʃieti` and `iɖʐe`.

Possessing a resplendent, ethereal presence, `seʃɹø` embodies exceptional beauty, tenderness, purity, and compassion. Her appearances before her devoted followers are frequent and transformative, emanating from a radiant halo of pristine white light. Among the pantheon of deities, she stands as one of the most captivating and resplendent. While her physique differs from that of `etiaʃi` and `aʃieti`, her allure lies in delicate curves and an exquisitely refined aura inherited from her mother. Every aspect, from her arms and hands to her vagina and feet, exudes a remarkable fragility. A lesser-known fact, divulged only to her closest confidants, advisors, and devotees, is her possession of a retractable penis inherited from her father. Though smaller in scale compared to his, it remains a slender and elongated feature, typically concealed from view. Clad in flowing, immaculate white robes cinched at the waist by a cord, she veils her body from scrutiny.

Accounts from those who have beheld `seʃɹø` depict a serene, radiant ambiance permeating their encounters. It is as if they float within the gentle embrace of the ethereal light radiating from the deity. Meetings with `seʃɹø` are suffused with an overwhelming sense of maternal love, akin to a long-awaited reunion with one's mother. Surprisingly, the deity lingers for an unexpectedly prolonged duration, tenderly caressing and nurturing her followers. Such an experience is widely regarded as one of the most comforting and surreal encounters one can experience.

Both `saiʃeʈa` and `saeθa` reverently describe their partner, highlighting her nurturing nature and modest demeanor. However, they express concern over `seʃɹø`'s pronounced vulnerability and trusting disposition. Consequently, she often engages with her followers without concern for her own safety, projecting an exceptionally transparent character. Fortunately, `saiʃeʈa` and `saeθa` emphasize that `seʃɹø` garners immense adoration from all deities, `aʋjasi`, and mortals alike, regardless of their allegiance or lineage. Only a truly malevolent and unrestrainedly destructive individual would harbor thoughts of inflicting harm upon `seʃɹø`.

`θaœ`
^^^^^

.. admonition:: Summary

    :Title: `aiɖi` of `itɹa` (Goddess of the Hidden)
    :Patronage: Alteration
	
`θaœ` is the `aiɖi` of `itɹa`, that which is hidden. She is popularly called the Hidden One. As the primary deity associated with Alteration `isʋe`, `θaœ` holds a position of significance. She arises as the offspring of `ajɛseɖi` and `etiaʃi`.

While inheriting her mother's remarkable beauty, `θaœ` predominantly shrouds herself in obscurity, seldom adopting a tangible form. Those fortunate enough to glimpse her presence encounter an exquisitely captivating silhouette amidst the shadows. Her countenance, often obscured by the veiling depths of her cowl, eludes easy recollection. Cloaked and wearing a skirt, her upper body remains exposed, adorned with enigmatic, dark geometric patterns. Among her defining features, her alluring, flowing hair emanates from the shadows, cascading gracefully between her breasts. Often braided, it effortlessly encircles her waist, swaying autonomously. Her voice resonates as a gentle whisper, imbued with a soothing quality. Her movements, discreet and elusive, can transpire imperceptibly, with individuals often unaware of her transition from before them to behind them.

Accounts from the fortunate few who have encountered `θaœ` highlight a befuddling impact on their minds. They describe a pervasive sense of relaxation, accompanied by a noticeable surrendering of their mental barriers and defenses. Some recount an enveloping cool mist, while others evoke sensations of an enigmatic warmth, inducing perspiration. Remarkably, individuals driven by insatiable curiosity may find themselves disheartened or discouraged, as if an overwhelming lethargy has beset them. Notably, once the presence of the deity has departed, these same individuals often experience a sense of regret.

`ajɛseɖi` notes that her daughter is not inherently shy. Rather, `θaœ` possesses an insatiable, unrivaled curiosity, surpassed only by `aɹœʈi`. However, she exhibits pronounced timidity and insecurity. When she overcomes these inhibitions, her intellect shines forth with unparalleled cleverness and innovation, rivaling even that of `aɹœʈi`. Intriguingly, she has inherited a subtle semblance of her mother's hypnotic and libidinous nature, though her reserved disposition tempers its manifestation.

`ʃɶða`
^^^^^^

.. admonition:: Summary

    :Title: `aiɖi` of `ʃɶi` (Goddess of Pleasure, Eroticism & Sex)
    :Patronage: Restoration

`ʃɶða` is the `aiɖi` of `ʃɶi`, sex. The revered deity enjoys paramount worship and followership, surpassing even `etiaʃi`, who remains highly venerated on `zai`. The temple of `ʃɶða` stands as a formidable influence among the sanctuaries present on the planet. Considering the inherent association of sexual activity with the revitalization of the soul, `ʃɶða` primarily aligns herself with `isʋe` disciplines devoted to Restoration. This illustrious deity traces her lineage to the union of `etiaʃi` and `ajɛseɖi`.

In her physical form, `ʃɶða` unmistakably reflects the attributes of her mother, radiating exceptional beauty, albeit in an exceedingly extravagant manner. She embodies an appearance that not only appeals to individual preferences but encompasses the epitome of allure. Notably, unlike `etiaʃi`, `ʃɶða` manifests a gender congruent with the observer's desires. Several constants define her captivating charm, notably her perpetual youthful visage, regardless of the observer's perception. Sporting a slender figure adorned with a delicate layer of desirable adipose tissue, her touch exudes a softness that captivates. The size of her breasts adapts to suit the preferences of the viewer, typically striking a balance between modesty and delicacy. Her waist appears slender, harmonizing with her strong hips and legs. Each step she takes exudes an alluring sway that accentuates her bodily attributes.

`ʃɶða` embodies a nature characterized by extremes. Witnesses who have encountered `ʃɶða` invariably recall engaging in sexual encounters with the deity. They recount an `aiɖi` who displays a tender, youthful demeanor, bordering on shyness in conversation, yet exhibits remarkable vigor, assertiveness, and dominance in the realm of intimacy. Her reserved disposition extends to interactions with her followers, partly influenced by the magnitude of her devotees. Preferring to maintain a degree of distance during such encounters, she speaks sparingly, instead preferring to listen intently to their conversations and pleas. When she does speak, her voice, akin to her mother's, emanates as a soft, sensual cadence that ensnares the listener's attention. Consistent with her paradoxical persona, `ʃɶða` always remains fully clothed from head to toe, a stark departure from her inherent inclinations.

`ajɛseɖi`, `ʃɶða's` mother, attests to her daughter's susceptibility to distraction, owing to her heightened sensitivity. She remarks, "It is fortunate that most entities within the Ethereal Plane maintain familial boundaries, as otherwise she would engage in amorous encounters with numerous fellow deities." In addition to her inherent shyness, `ʃɶða` exhibits a penchant for decadence, relishing in opulent displays of activities and an excess of material pleasures. While sharing her mother's libidinous nature, `ʃɶða's` desires manifest in distinct ways. While `etiaʃi` remains dedicated to sexual experiences with a select few, `ʃɶða` actively seeks a diverse range of partners, seldom engaging in repeat encounters. Although capable of experiencing love and indulging in recurring intimate liaisons, `ʃɶða` frequently seeks novelty. It is important not to mistake her apparent flightiness and perceived lack of intelligence as inherent traits; rather, they arise as consequences of her physical sensitivity and propensity for distractions. Beneath these surface traits, one discovers an immensely intelligent and vivacious force of nature.

`dœʋa`
^^^^^^

.. admonition:: Summary

    :Title: `aiɖi` of `aʃi` & `ɶʂi` (Goddess of Future and Air)
    :Patronage: Air & Divination

`dœʋa` is the `aiɖi` of `aʃi` and `ɶʂi`, the future and air. Born to the union of `iʈʂedy`, `dœʋa` inherits mastery over the future while also possessing dominion over the element of air. As the primary patron of Divination and Air `isʋe`, she emerges as a significant deity in these domains, tracing her lineage to `iʈʂedy` and `saiʃeʈa`.

`dœʋa` manifests as an exceedingly slender figure. Initially, her diminutive physique may convey a sense of fragility and delicacy, yet it belies an unexpected strength that often catches observers off guard. Notably distinct from other `aiɖi`, she closely resembles her mother, `iʈʂedy`, surpassing even `saiʃeʈa` in resemblance. Some even assert that `dœʋa` possesses a wiry frame that surpasses her mother's. Like `iʈʂedy`, she features small breasts and a waist that subtly blends into her hips. Differing from her mother, however, `dœʋa` does not inherit a phallus but instead presents with a vagina akin to `saiʃeʈa`. Her elongated legs contribute to the illusion of fragility, yet her movements exude grace and subtlety. Renowned for her remarkably light touch, she possesses exceptional skills in pickpocketing. While her physique harbors well-defined muscles, they remain concealed to the casual observer. Adorned in billowing white robes that perpetually flow outward, her attire fails in its attempt to provide ample coverage.

The arrival of `dœʋa` is customarily heralded by gusts of wind, whose nature may range from turbulent to tranquil, but never absent. Similarly unpredictable are her mannerisms, defying assumptions and frequently deviating from anticipated behavior (unless no assumptions are made at all). Moreover, few secrets can be kept hidden from her discerning gaze. Although her brilliance often surprises her followers, it is important to note that she does not possess constant clairvoyance. Instead, she exhibits exceptional anticipation and deductive abilities. Yet, the advantage she gains from her foresight and intellect is counterbalanced by her capricious and impulsive nature. Among the `aiɖi`, she stands as one of the most obstinate and uncooperative, rarely granting the fulfillment of wishes.

According to `saiʃeʈa`, her mother, `dœʋa` emanates an air of grace and tranquility despite her seemingly mannerless disposition. `saiʃeʈa` characterizes her daughter's behavior as akin to that of her own: disorganized and reclusive. Unlike her more perilous and cunning siblings, `dœʋa` exhibits a certain naivety and contentment, although her nature is markedly more transient than that of `ʋaðœ`.

`ʋaðœ`
^^^^^^

.. admonition:: Summary

    :Title: `aiɖi` of `eʒi` & `øʐi` (Goddess of Past and Earth)
    :Patronage: Earth & Divination
	
`ʋaðœ` is the `aiɖi` of `eʒi` and `øʐi`, the past and earth. Born to the union of `iʈʂedy`, `ʋaðœ` inherits authority over the past while also commanding dominion over the element of earth. As the primary patron of Divination and Earth `isʋe`, she emerges as a significant deity in these realms, tracing her lineage to `iʈʂedy` and `saeθa`.

`ʋaðœ` can be aptly described as solid. Physically, she possesses a larger stature compared to her sister and bears greater resemblance to `saeθa` rather than `iʈʂedy`. However, even these inheritances do not manifest flawlessly. `ʋaðœ` is short yet muscular, lacking the curvaceous form associated with other `aiɖi`. Her breasts are small, and her hips and waist blend seamlessly. Nonetheless, `ʋaðœ` exudes a robust presence. Her hands are equivalent to the combined size of both thighs of `dœʋa`, exhibiting exceptional strength. Her posture exudes firmness and solidity, while her gait, though less graceful, radiates immense power. Despite her youthful and vibrant countenance, her face carries a knowing and burdened expression. Notably, `ʋaðœ` inherits her mother's retractable penis, albeit on a grander scale. Indeed, her penis stands as the most imposing among all `aiɖi`, surpassing others in both length and girth, consistently remaining upright—a reflection of her unwavering personality. `ʋaðœ` predominantly keeps her phallus visible, particularly considering that her interactions with `aiɖi` and followers occur primarily in a state of nudity. However, it is essential to acknowledge that the sight of `ʋaðœ` unclothed may not always be aesthetically pleasing due to her typically dirty and unkempt appearance.

The followers of `ʋaðœ` gravitate toward her for her wisdom and knowledge. She is revered for her unwavering commitment to self-improvement and righteousness. Nevertheless, she can be characterized as stubborn and cold, although her coldness differs from that of her distant sisters, stemming from her resolute and callous nature. `ʋaðœ` adheres strictly to her established ways and does not readily embrace change. Conversely, akin to her sister `dœʋa`, she approaches various aspects of life with contentment.

According to `saeθa`, her mother, `ʋaðœ` exhibits an extreme possessiveness, likely stemming from her aversion to change. Despite her rough and uncivilized demeanor, she exudes a subtle charm. Interestingly, `saeθa` once remarked that `ʋaðœ`'s firmness, callousness, and uncouth nature serve as a beneficial defense against the overwhelming desire of others seeking to experience her more impressive attributes.

    :Title: `aiɖi` of `azesjɛ itʃiaʃi` & `yʂi` (Goddess of Recreation of the Living and Water)
    :Patronage: Water & Restoration
	
`yʈʂi` is the `aiɖi` of `azesjɛ itʃiaʃi` & `yʂi`, recreation of the living and water. As such, she holds the esteemed position of being the primary patron of Restoration and Water `isʋe`. Born to the union of `seʃɹø` and `dœʋa`, she emerges as a significant entity within these domains.

`yʈʂi` embodies an attractive and meticulous nature. Like her sister, she possesses a lean and athletic physique, projecting strength and agility. Her graceful demeanor and refined appearance captivate all those who encounter her. In contrast to the confidence exuded by `saɹeθɶ`, `yʈʂi` emanates elegance with a touch of seduction, using her captivating presence to enchant and mesmerize. Resembling her half-sister `saɹeθɶ`, she manifests a harmonious balance in her attributes—-an equilibrium between muscle and fat, medium-length hair, medium-sized breasts, and a figure that strikes a balance between curvature and slenderness. Notably, `yʈʂi` inherited both her mother's and grandmother's penis, which remains non-retractable, coexisting with her vagina. To conceal this aspect, she typically adorns breeches. However, her upper attire often comprises a flamboyant blue midriff garment adorned with intricate golden embellishments, showcasing her lean and attractive physique.

Encounters with `yʈʂi`, even for mortals, often elicit descriptions of timidity and allure. She exudes attractiveness and captivation, though not in an overt manner. Similar to her sister, `yʈʂi` presents herself with an air of normality, devoid of halos or other supernatural manifestations. Apart from her flamboyant attire, she is indistinguishable from an ordinary mortal.

However, `yʈʂi`'s mother, `saeθa`, cautions that beneath her timid and endearing appearance, her personality shares similarities with `saɹeθɶ`. While not inclined towards calculation or brutality, `yʈʂi` exhibits a cold and callous nature, particularly in times of conflict. Her reliability is notably questionable, requiring vigilance when interpreting her words. Although this charming yet aloof `aiɖi` can be somewhat disconcerting, `saeθa` assures us that `yʈʂi` also possesses a caring and magnanimous side. Nonetheless, her capriciousness makes it difficult to anticipate her actions.
