.. dropdown:: On Inspirations for the `isiʈeθɶ` and `zœeɖaʃi`
    :icon: clock
    :color: warning
    
    On the appearance of the `aʋjasi`, while the facial structure is dependent upon the inspiration, other broader attributes (such as eye color, hair color, etc.) are separate from the inspiration. Moreover, each `aʋjasi` has a heraldic color which also determines the theme of their doctrinal dress. All of this is featured on :doc:`this page <avyasi-planning>` because of the amount of content.
