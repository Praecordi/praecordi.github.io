`zea ʈeaθyɖa`
=============

`ajɛsɖɶ zea ʈeaθyɖa`
--------------------

The `zea ʈeaθyɖa ajɛsɖɶ` are created by `isiʈeθɶ ajɛseɖi` who is aided by her partner and `aiɖi`, `etiaʃi`. `ajɛseɖi` used the second technique of creation when creating the `ajɛsɖɶ`. The `ajɛsɖɶ` were initially modeled from clay and cloth. `ajɛseɖi` modeled the race and this single gender from her own body.

The first and average height of an `ajɛsɖɶ` closely resembled that of `ajɛseɖi`. However, subsequent to the ritual and the modifications made to `ajɛseɖi`, the first `ajɛsɖɶ` became shorter than `ajɛseɖi`, with their mouth reaching her breasts. The `ajɛsɖɶ` possess lithe bodies and notably long hair on their heads. Unlike `aθɶs` females, they lack pubic hair growth, and their eyes lack eyelashes. Instead, their eyes feature a protective nictitating membrane that shields against foreign particles. Furthermore, their eyes are deeply set, while their noses, ears, and lips bear closer resemblance to those of `aθɶs` humans. The overall bodily proportions of the `ajɛsɖɶ` are partially influenced by the `isiʈeθɶ`.

While `ajɛseɖi` played a significant role in the creation process of the `ajɛsɖɶ`, several physical attributes can be attributed to `etiaʃi`. These include their remarkably fast-growing hair, which directly connects to their spinal cord and functions as a partial extension of their brain. Additionally, the `ajɛsɖɶ` possess heightened hearing and olfactory senses, the aforementioned nictitating membrane, and surface blood veins on their breasts that expand during arousal. Among the internal attributes bestowed upon the `ajɛsɖɶ` by `etiaʃi`, their natural curiosity and intelligence are noteworthy, as is their libidinous nature. Consequently, it is common for an `ajɛsɖɶ` to experience increased clarity of thought and focus following an orgasm. `ajɛseɖi` incorporated a rudimentary reproductive system in her design, which was subsequently perfected by `etiaʃi`.

In the subsequent discussion, we will explore the `zea ʈeaθyɖa ajɛsɖɶ` in comparison to Earth and `aθɶs` humans.

.. rubric:: Physical Description

In terms of external physical characteristics, the `ajɛsɖɶ` exhibit a closer resemblance to `aθɶs` humans compared to the other two genders. As previously mentioned, the `ajɛsɖɶ` are derived from the `aθɶs` human female. Several noticeable distinctions exist between these two populations. The most prominent dissimilarity is the presence of two tentacle-like appendages known as `ajɛstɹaɹi`, which protrude from the back just below the shoulder blades. These projections, albeit relatively short in length for the `ajɛsɖɶ`, reaching only to the knees, lack any skeletal structures. Instead, they consist entirely of muscular tissue and possess a limited range of motion. Unlike hands, they lack agility and lack any digits or suckers found in certain animal species, which limits their grasping capabilities. The `ajɛstɹaɹi` terminate with hair that establishes neural connections with the `ajɛsɖɶ` nervous system. This enables a form of interface between two `ajɛsɖɶ` individuals and, as we will explore later, facilitates reproductive processes.

The second significant deviation lies in the fact that, unlike in `aθɶs` humans, the majority, if not all, of the `ajɛsɖɶ` possess symmastic breasts. This implies an extension of breast tissues across the intermammary cleft, resulting in a diminished cleavage area. Conversely, while symmastic breasts are relatively uncommon among `aθɶs` females, they do occur. The third disparity between `aθɶs` humans and `ajɛsɖɶ` is the presence of an additional digit in the hands and feet of the `ajɛsɖɶ`.

In addition to these overt physical distinctions observed in an average `ajɛsɖɶ` compared to an `aθɶs` human, several general population differences can be discerned. For instance, `ajɛsɖɶ` breasts tend to be larger than those of `aθɶs` females. With few exceptions, an unaltered `ajɛsɖɶ` will exhibit a well-defined chest with noticeable curvature and roundness. Furthermore, the average `ajɛsɖɶ` possesses numerous features that are typically associated with beauty in an `aθɶs` woman, including clear and smooth skin, symmetrical facial characteristics, voluminous hair, large expressive eyes, and delicate facial features. Nonetheless, it is important to note that `ʈeaθyɖa` beauty standards differ significantly from those of `aθɶs`.

Another distinction, although not exclusively physical, pertains to diminished tactile sensitivity, particularly in the lower legs, upper arms, and chest regions of the `ajɛsɖɶ`. This is primarily attributed to the absence of hair and neural endings in these areas. Conversely, the stomach, vaginal region, and thighs exhibit heightened sensitivity, while dullness in tactile perception resumes in the lower legs. Similar to humans, the hands provide the most reliable source of tactile feedback. Lastly, a notable difference lies in the anatomical structure of the vaginal opening. As previously mentioned, small projections located near the interior of the vagina guide small gametes towards the eggs. These projections possess nerve endings, rendering them one of the most sensitive areas of the `ajɛsɖɶ` body. Alongside stimulation of the clitoris, stimulating these projections serves as the primary means of inducing an orgasm in an `ajɛsɖɶ`.

.. rubric:: Reproduction

One notable distinction of the `ajɛsɖɶ` is their oviparous nature, wherein they lay eggs instead of giving birth to fully developed zygotes. Specifically, the `ajɛsɖɶ` exhibit hermaphroditism, possessing two distinct gametes: positive and negative. The positive gametes are large and immobile, ultimately maturing into eggs, while the negative gametes, although also immobile, are smaller and resemble sperm. Both gametes are haploid, carrying a single set of chromosomes that combine to form a diploid zygote. During meiosis, unlike the production of four sperm cells, an `ajɛsɖɶ` generates two positive and two negative gametes. These gametes are formed within an organ resembling an ovary. As the large positive gamete traverses the oviduct, it undergoes further development, while the smaller negative gametes travel to the clitoris, where they await insemination into the parent.

The initiation of egg production is triggered by hormonal changes that occur when the neural hair of the mother comes into contact with the partner's neural hair, signaling the onset of reproduction. Insemination generally transpires during clitoral contact. Within the vagina, small projections function as filters, selectively guiding negative gametes toward the egg. Self-insemination is not possible, rendering an egg inert if fertilized by the individual's own gametes. Successful insemination is a complex process that requires time. If egg production has commenced, but insemination fails, the egg becomes inert and unable to be fertilized externally. Similarly, attempting to inseminate an `ajɛsɖɶ` without the initiation of egg production will also result in an unsuccessful endeavor. It is worth noting that in certain instances, both partners may lay eggs simultaneously, leading to a relationship akin to fraternal twins among their offspring.

The journey of the negative gamete toward the oviduct takes approximately 2-3 months (using human time approximation). Once insemination occurs, the zygote gradually descends the oviduct, progressively developing the yolk, albumen, and ultimately the shell, until it is expelled from the vagina. This entire process spans a mere 4-5 days (using human time approximation). The resulting egg, roughly the length of a forearm and the width of a hand, is then placed in a warm environment to facilitate its development. In ancient times, this entailed a dedicated room or separate tent with carefully regulated fire and cooling facilities, where the egg would be situated in a container typically filled with a wool-like substance. In modern times, wealthier individuals may possess their own incubators created by hired specialists known as `isʋe`. Alternatively, for those with more limited financial resources, the `isiʈeθɶ` offer communal incubators equipped with guards and parental beds. Subsequently, the egg undergoes an incubation period of approximately 6 months (using human time approximation) until hatching occurs.

.. 
    Once the egg has hatched, it is usually fed milk secreted from the parents’ breasts. The development of milk starts much earlier when puberty hits rather than at insemination. There is no requirement on which parent feeds, although this is usually done by the parent that has not given birth to the egg. While this is less biologically related and more cultural, in case of twins, both parents feed consecutively with one feeding one day, while the other the next. Complete weaning happens much later than humans at about 7-8 years after birth, but at the same time, `ajɛsɖɶ` child development is much slower.

.. rubric:: Development

The average lifespan of a `zea ʈeaθyɖa ajɛsɖɶ` ranges from approximately 150 to 175 years, with some individuals possibly reaching the age of 200. As previously mentioned, an `ajɛsɖɶ` child is typically weaned 7 to 8 years after birth. By the age of one, an `ajɛsɖɶ` child gains the ability to sit up and crawl. At two years of age, they progress to walking and comprehending simple commands. The recognition of individuals, along with the development of basic speech and understanding of simple words, also commences during this period. Additionally, the eruption of teeth and weight gain become noticeable milestones. By the age of three, an `ajɛsɖɶ` child can run, form sentences longer than three words, and express desires, while gradually exhibiting increased physical strength.

By the age of five, the majority of an `ajɛsɖɶ` child's teeth have emerged, and they have achieved proper toilet training. Although fat tends to decrease during this phase, their dietary needs expand beyond milk consumption. At seven years of age, `ajɛsɖɶ` children become more socially inclined, establishing relationships beyond immediate family members. Formal education, encompassing reading and writing, typically commences during this period. Physically, they exhibit the proportions characteristic of an `ajɛsɖɶ`, albeit not attaining their full height.

Upon reaching 12 years of age, an `ajɛsɖɶ` begins the development of their `ajɛstɹaɹi`. By 15 years, the `ajɛstɹaɹi` reaches its completed development, relative to their height. At 17 years, most of their growth potential is realized, and the onset of breast development occurs. Concurrently, the `ajɛsɖɶ` starts accumulating fat and experiences a robust sexual attraction. By 19 years, puberty concludes, with breast growth and the full development of sexual organs achieved. At this stage, the `ajɛsɖɶ` gains the ability to give birth and provide nourishment through breastfeeding.

Between the ages of 19 and 40 years, the `ajɛsɖɶ` can be regarded as equivalent to young adulthood in humans. From 41 to 120 years, they enjoy a physically vibrant body, capable of various activities. However, beyond this stage, signs of aging manifest, such as sagging skin, dental weakening, graying or loss of hair, and muscle deterioration.


`ɖiʒiɖi zea ʈeaθyɖa`
--------------------

The `zea ʈeaθyɖa ɖiʒiɖi`, often mistakenly believed to be the most recent addition to the gender spectrum, constitute the second gender category. These beings are brought into existence through the collaborative efforts of `isiʈeθɶ saeθa`, with assistance from the `aiɖi` known as `zɛɹa`. `saeθa` employed a distinct technique to create the `ɖiʒiɖi` population, initially modeling them from materials such as wood and grass. The conception of the `ɖiʒiɖi` gender arose from the necessity to address the reproductive challenges faced by the `ajɛsɖɶ` species. In their quest for increased procreation rates, the `ajɛsɖɶ` speculated that accelerated egg development and hatching would lead to a higher number of offspring. However, this expectation proved inaccurate, as the negative gametes encountered difficulties reaching the oviducts for proper embryonic development. Consequently, `saeθa` was entrusted with the task of devising a male equivalent within the `zea ʈeaθyɖa` species, while ensuring that they would not assume the dominant and abusive role prevalent in `aθɶs`.

The initial `ɖiʒiɖi` specimens exhibited a slightly shorter stature compared to their `ajɛsɖɶ` counterparts, characterized by slim and lean bodies. They boasted remarkably long hair on their heads, akin to the `ajɛsɖɶ`, and lacked pubic growth. Moreover, the `ɖiʒiɖi` lacked eyelashes, instead featuring a nictitating membrane to shield their eyes from particles. Their eyes were deeply set and displayed enhanced nasal, aural, and labial characteristics reminiscent of `aθɶs` humans. The bodily proportions of the `ɖiʒiɖi` were influenced by the physical traits of the `aiɖi`.

The creative process behind the `ɖiʒiɖi` involved input from `ajɛseɖi`, although the majority of decisions were made by `saeθa`. While `saeθa` primarily determined the physical attributes, and `zɛɹa` contributed to the mental and behavioral aspects, one significant physical attribute—the penis—was exclusively developed by `zɛɹa`. Mentally, the `ɖiʒiɖi` exhibit similarities to `zɛɹa`, displaying traits of being soft-spoken, timid, and loyal. Behind this gentle demeanor lies a capable and intelligent mind, accompanied by precise control over their bodies and senses. Given their role as companions to the `ajɛsɖɶ`, they demonstrate unwavering loyalty ingrained in their nature, making it exceptionally challenging to override. Recognizing the potential for exploitation of such devoted beings, `zɛɹa` endowed them with exceptional mental acuity. In collaboration with `zɛɹa`, `ajɛseɖi` devised a rudimentary reproductive system for the `ɖiʒiɖi` that seamlessly integrates with the reproductive system of the `ajɛsɖɶ`, thereby fulfilling their purpose as both mental and sexual companions to their `ajɛsɖɶ` counterparts.

In our examination of the `zea ʈeaθyɖa ɖiʒiɖi`, we will not only compare them to `aθɶs` humans but also delve into their unique characteristics when juxtaposed with their `ajɛsɖɶ` counterparts. 

.. rubric:: Physical Description

In terms of physical appearance, the `ɖiʒiɖi` closely resemble `aθɶs` human females, despite the presence of a distinct organ that deviates from typical female anatomy. Similar to `ajɛsɖɶ`, `ɖiʒiɖi` breasts tend to be larger than those of `aθɶs` females. However, `ɖiʒiɖi` possess slimmer and leaner bodies compared to `ajɛsɖɶ`, featuring narrow hips and an elongated midsection. Contrary to the diverse skin tones and hair colors found in `ajɛsɖɶ`, most `ɖiʒiɖi` exhibit pale shades and silver hair. Their eyes emit a faint glow and possess lighter hues than any `ajɛsɖɶ`. Furthermore, `ɖiʒiɖi` exhibit a lower distribution of body fat throughout their physique. Although slightly shorter than `ajɛsɖɶ`, `ɖiʒiɖi` have significantly longer `ajɛstɹaɹi`, reaching their ankles rather than their knees. Notably, the `ajɛstɹaɹi` terminate with a head similar to the heads of their penises. While these heads are sensitive, they do not emit any fluids. They serve the purpose of arousal and are considered a marker of beauty, often used to assess the attractiveness of a `ɖiʒiɖi`. Despite these differences, the mobility of the `ajɛstɹaɹi` remains comparable to that of `ajɛsɖɶ ajɛstɹaɹi`. Additionally, like `ajɛsɖɶ`, `ɖiʒiɖi` possess an extra digit on each hand.

Another distinctive aspect of `ɖiʒiɖi` is their breast structure. While not symmastic, `ɖiʒiɖi` breasts differ from those of `ajɛsɖɶ`. Apart from being larger on average, they contain surface blood vessels that engorge with blood during arousal or specific weather conditions. These breasts exhibit similarities to their penises in terms of response to stimulation.

Lastly, we shall explore the unique organ possessed by the `ɖiʒiɖi`, which was intricately designed by `zɛɹa`. The `ɖiʒiɖi` member bears resemblance to that of the `aiɖi` in several aspects. Similar to male humans, `ɖiʒiɖi` possess a foreskin that remains intact, unlike the surgical removal practiced by certain human populations. Generally, the `ɖiʒiɖi` penis exhibits larger proportions in relation to their body compared to male humans. The head of the `ɖiʒiɖi` member is highly sensitive when exposed, while the shaft is covered in a thick, ridged skin. The underside of the shaft contains intermittent openings, revealing sensitive fleshy tissue. These areas are highly sensitive and erogenous, with stimulation of the exposed head commonly leading to orgasm in `ɖiʒiɖi`. In contrast to humans, the `ɖiʒiɖi` do not possess external testes; instead, they are internally stored within their bodies. Notably, a significant distinction between humans and `ɖiʒiɖi` is the expansion of the `ɖiʒiɖi` member's head after orgasm, effectively retaining the `ɖiʒiɖi` within their partner. The duration of this expansion varies based on fluid expulsion and discharge rate, although immediate reduction does not occur upon complete fluid release.


.. rubric:: Reproduction

As previously mentioned, the `ɖiʒiɖi` possess a penis but lack a vagina and oviduct, rendering them incapable of giving birth. In order to reproduce, a `ɖiʒiɖi` requires the presence of an `ajɛsɖɶ` or, as we will discuss later, an `esiʈi`. The `ɖiʒiɖi` produce a single type of gamete known as the d-negative gamete, which bears resemblance to motile sperm. These d-negative gametes are haploid, containing a single set of chromosomes that combine with the positive gametes of an `ajɛsɖɶ` to form a diploid zygote. The production of d-negative gametes occurs internally within an organ similar to the testes, which, akin to human testes, are situated outside the main body. The development and release of d-negative gametes are regulated by additional organs and hormones.

.. sidebar::
    
    From a behavioral standpoint, the `ɖiʒiɖi` are regarded as more submissive partners compared to the `ajɛsɖɶ`, often assuming a more passive role during sexual interactions, with the `ajɛsɖɶ` taking a more active position.

Since the `ɖiʒiɖi` do not produce eggs and continuously generate d-negative gametes, we can proceed directly to the process of insemination. In the absence of neural hair, the production of eggs in `ɖiʒiɖi` initiates through hormonal changes triggered by contact between their neural hair and breasts. As previously mentioned, the `ɖiʒiɖi` penis was designed to facilitate efficient insemination. Insemination follows a more conventional human approach, where an `ajɛsɖɶ` inserts the penis of a `ɖiʒiɖi` into their vagina. This bypasses the need for gametes to travel towards the egg, reducing the duration from 2-3 months to approximately 1-2 days. Once insemination occurs, the release of the egg proceeds similarly to the process described earlier for mating between two `ajɛsɖɶ`. It is worth noting that unlike eggs resulting from the union of two `ajɛsɖɶ`, eggs produced through the mating of an `ajɛsɖɶ` and a `ɖiʒiɖi` require only 3 months to hatch, as opposed to 6 months.

Regarding the gender of the offspring, it depends on the genetic composition of the parents. `ajɛsɖɶ` lack sex chromosomes, traditionally represented as "O" to indicate their absence. Conversely, `ɖiʒiɖi` possess the Y chromosome. Generally, the presence of a sex chromosome, particularly the Y chromosome, prevails over its absence. Thus, a child with a single Y chromosome will be classified as a `ɖiʒiɖi`. These `ɖiʒiɖi` offspring are commonly referred to as omega `ɖiʒiɖi`. The specific type of `ɖiʒiɖi` is not immediately discernible at birth, but as they mature, omega `ɖiʒiɖi` tend to exhibit slightly broader hips while possessing smaller breasts, inheriting certain traits from their `ajɛsɖɶ` genetic makeup.

Consequently, when an `ajɛsɖɶ` and `ɖiʒiɖi` engage in procreation, they will invariably give birth to an omega `ɖiʒiɖi`. In the case of an `ajɛsɖɶ` and an omega `ɖiʒiɖi` procreating, there is a 50% chance of the `ajɛsɖɶ` giving birth to either a pure `ajɛsɖɶ` or another omega `ɖiʒiɖi`.

..
    The care of a child once hatched is usually given to the `ɖiʒiɖi`. The nursing of a child is more dependent on the gender of a child, though this is more cultural rather than anatomical. A `ɖiʒiɖi` child will usually be given milk by the mother, or the `ajɛsɖɶ`, while an `ajɛsɖɶ` child will be given more milk by the father, the `ɖiʒiɖi`. Like an `ajɛsɖɶ`, the milk production of a `ɖiʒiɖi` starts at puberty. Another more cultural trait is weaning for a `ɖiʒiɖi` child happens much later than an `ajɛsɖɶ` child, although child development for both is approximately the same.

.. rubric:: Development

The developmental trajectory of a `zea ʈeaθyɖa ɖiʒiɖi` follows a pattern similar to that of an `ajɛsɖɶ`. The average lifespan of a `zea ʈeaθyɖa ajɛsɖɶ` ranges from approximately 140 to 160 years, with their lifespan concluding slightly earlier than that of an `ajɛsɖɶ`. Notably, `ɖiʒiɖi` offspring do not possess `ajɛstɹaɹi` at this stage.

By the age of one, a `ɖiʒiɖi` child achieves the ability to sit up and crawl. At two years, they exhibit walking proficiency and comprehend simple commands. Additionally, they begin recognizing individuals, engaging in basic verbal communication, and comprehending simple vocabulary. Teeth begin to emerge, and weight gain becomes evident during this stage. At three years old, they develop the capacity to run, construct sentences exceeding three words, and express desires with greater linguistic complexity. Their physical strength also increases.

Around the age of five, most of the child's teeth have fully erupted, and they become fully toilet-trained. Although body fat tends to diminish, their dietary requirements expand beyond milk supplementation. At seven years old, socialization broadens as they establish relationships extending beyond immediate family members. Educational endeavors commence, encompassing reading and writing skills. Physically, their proportions align with those typical of a `ɖiʒiɖi`, although full height attainment has yet to be reached.

Upon reaching 12 years old, the `ajɛsɖɶ` initiates `ajɛstɹaɹi` development, while the `ɖiʒiɖi` experiences the onset of penis development. Skin undergoes thickening and receding, and muscular development occurs. Until sexual maturation is complete, sporadic erections may occur. At 15 years old, `ajɛstɹaɹi` development concludes in terms of proportional size relative to height. By 17 years, most of their physical potential is realized, and breast development commences in the `ajɛsɖɶ`. The `ɖiʒiɖi` begins to gain weight in adipose tissue. At this stage, many `ɖiʒiɖi` are weaned, coinciding with the onset of breast development. At 19 years old, puberty reaches completion, marked by breast growth and the culmination of sexual organ development. `ɖiʒiɖi` become capable of childbirth and lactation for their own offspring.

Between the ages of 19 and 40, the `ɖiʒiɖi` can be considered the equivalent of young adulthood in humans. From 41 years to approximately 110 years, they enjoy a fully energetic physique capable of various activities. Differing from the `ajɛsɖɶ`, the formidable years of the `ɖiʒiɖi` are characterized by a period of intense heat, coinciding with a specific stage in the lunar cycle. The exact timing is unique to each `ɖiʒiɖi`, and this experience triggers a strong sexual urge, accompanied by a sudden surge in energy, enhanced stamina, and significant fluid discharge. After this phase, signs of aging become apparent, including skin laxity, tooth weakening, graying or loss of hair, and muscle deterioration.


`esiʈi zea ʈeaθyɖa`
-------------------

The `zea ʈeaθyɖa esiʈi` represents the third gender, their creation attributed to the efforts of `isiʈeθɶ saiʃeʈa` in collaboration with the assistance of `aiɖi` known as `iɖʐe`. The technique employed by `saiʃeʈa` in the formation of the `esiʈi` involved the utilization of forged iron as the initial modeling material. The purpose behind the creation of the `esiʈi` gender stemmed from the aspiration for a more robust and powerful gender capable of excelling in various domains such as labor, creation, and warfare. Historically, both `ajɛseɖi` and `saeθa`, alongside their respective offspring, have been viewed through a lens of gentleness and non-violence. Consequently, the races generated from these lineages, although possessing the capacity for aggression, did not possess the inherent disposition of a warlike race capable of matching the formidable nature of `aθɶs` culture. To address this need, `saiʃeʈa` was entrusted with the task of fashioning the `esiʈi` race, endowed with the requisite power and strength to bolster the military forces of `zai`.

The average `esiʈi` possesses a tall stature comparable to that of the transformed `isiʈeθɶ`. They exhibit a well-built physique, characterized by muscularity and agility. Their hair is thicker and exhibits keratin-like growth patterns. Similar to the `ajɛsɖɶ` and `ɖiʒiɖi`, the `esiʈi` lack pubic hair. Resembling the `isiʈeθɶ`, the `esiʈi` possess `ajɛstɹaɹi` of shorter length, positioned beneath the shoulder blades. These appendages are notably robust and flexible, showcasing strength comparable to the arms of an `esiʈi`. Additionally, the `esiʈi` lack eyelashes and eyebrows, featuring deeply inset eyes. Their noses, ears, and lips bear closer resemblance to those of `aθɶs` humans and Earth humans. The bodily proportions of the `esiʈi` are influenced by those of the `aiɖi`.

During the creation of the `esiʈi`, the major decision-making authority rested with `saiʃeʈa` and `iɖʐe`. The physical attributes of the `esiʈi` were extensively deliberated upon and agreed upon by both entities. `esiʈi` possess exceptional vision and hearing capabilities. Their bodies naturally produce a protein that enables certain areas of their skin to harden akin to a shell, conferring a form of inherent armor. From a young age, their physical condition is notably robust, granting them heightened stamina and strength, although they are inclined to rest after periods of exertion. In terms of mental and behavioral attributes, the `esiʈi` exhibit emotional capacities akin to the `ajɛsɖɶ`. While they possess a natural predisposition towards aggression, they also exhibit a stronger herd mentality. At the behest of `ajɛseɖi` and `saeθa`, `iɖʐe` incorporated a need for `ajɛsɖɶ` and `ɖiʒiɖi` milk within the `esiʈi`. Collaborating with the `iɖʐe`, `ajɛseɖi` devised a rudimentary reproductive system that harmonizes with the reproductive systems of the `ajɛsɖɶ` and `ɖiʒiɖi`.

In the subsequent discussion, we shall explore the `zea ʈeaθyɖa esiʈi` in comparison to not only `aθɶs` humans but also their counterparts, the `ajɛsɖɶ` and `ɖiʒiɖi`.

.. rubric:: Physical Description

In terms of physical appearance, the `esiʈi` exhibit a greater resemblance to the `ajɛsɖɶ` rather than the `ɖiʒiɖi`. Being the largest among the three genders, the `esiʈi` possess a towering stature that often rivals that of the `isiʈeθɶ`. Their body structure shares similarities with the `ajɛsɖɶ`, but with noticeably more pronounced muscle development. Even the weakest `esiʈi` can effortlessly match the strength of a particularly robust `ajɛsɖɶ` or `ɖiʒiɖi`. Notably, the `esiʈi` face considerable challenges when it comes to weight gain. The `ajɛstɹaɹi` of an `esiʈi` are considerably longer compared to those of the `ajɛsɖɶ`, akin to the `ɖiʒiɖi`, while possessing a tip resembling that of the `ajɛsɖɶ`. Moreover, the `ajɛstɹaɹi` exhibits greater strength than those of the `ajɛsɖɶ` or `ɖiʒiɖi`, enabling them to lift an entire `ajɛsɖɶ` or `ɖiʒiɖi` with relative ease. Their mobility is significantly enhanced in comparison. Diverging from the `ajɛsɖɶ` and `ɖiʒiɖi`, the `esiʈi` possess `ajɛstɹaɹi` that secrete a sticky chemical similar to sweat, providing improved grip. While this fluid can be voluntarily secreted, it may also occur under specific weather conditions. Due to its scent, the secretion is considered unattractive.

Contrasting both the `ajɛsɖɶ` and `ɖiʒiɖi`, the `esiʈi` boast golden skin and hair in varying shades of red. The eyes of most `esiʈi` exhibit vivid and untamed colors. However, it is noteworthy that the breast size of an `esiʈi` is smaller compared to either gender. Similar to the `ajɛsɖɶ`, the breasts of the `esiʈi` possess surface blood vessels, facilitating their enlargement when aroused. Consequently, in the midst of battle, the breasts are afforded additional protection, as severing them in an aroused state significantly increases the risk of fatal blood loss. Additionally, a naturally occurring protein enables the `esiʈi` to temporarily harden certain parts of their body, such as their stomach, rendering them resistant to attacks. Finally, distinct from both the `ajɛsɖɶ` and `ɖiʒiɖi`, the `esiʈi` lack a highly sensitive erogenous zone akin to the `ajɛsɖɶ`'s vaginal projection or the `ɖiʒiɖi`'s breasts. Consequently, reproduction with an `esiʈi` poses greater challenges, as they find it more difficult to achieve the necessary number of orgasms for conception.

.. rubric:: Reproduction

The `esiʈi` possess a vaginal structure similar to that of the `ajɛsɖɶ`. Similar to the `ajɛsɖɶ`, the `esiʈi` are hermaphrodites, possessing two types of gametes: e-positive and e-negative. The positive gamete is large and immobile, while the negative gamete is smaller and motile. Both gametes are haploid and form a diploid zygote. Unlike the `ajɛsɖɶ`, the `esiʈi` gametes are distributed unequally, with fewer e-negative gametes than e-positives. The e-positive gametes remain in an ovary-like organ for some months. The gametes develop into fully grown eggs, regardless of being fertilized or not. At the end of their cycle, the eggs are discharged out of the body, and another one is made in its stead. The e-negative gametes are stored in a sack-like structure near the vaginal opening. These are mixed with a liquid in the sack, and although not regularly discharged, they are sprayed out during strong sexual climax. This liquid, commonly called the `esiʈi` spray, is constantly regenerated.

.. sidebar:: `esiʈi` discharges
    
    In many cultures, discharged eggs are kept by the `esiʈi` for religious purposes. Some believe them to be prisons for souls not meant for this earth, even while others believe they are an encasing for the soul slowly slipping out of them, creeping closely towards death. Thus in some cultures, unfertilized eggs are kept as remembrances of their family, while in others they are immediately disposed of as waste.

    On the other hand, `esiʈi` spray is a commodity. An `esiʈi` spraying is a sign of incoming pregnancy, both in the sense that if an `esiʈi` sprays, she has achieved a powerful enough orgasm to commence fertilization, but also that an `esiʈi` spray can make another `esiʈi` or `ajɛsɖɶ` pregnant.

Fertilization of an egg occurs only when the proper hormones are activated during intense sexual climaxes. These orgasms need to be extremely strong, but need not be induced by a single partner. Similar to the `ajɛsɖɶ`, small projections in the vagina guide the negative gametes towards the ovary-like organ, but the negative gametes will not be absorbed into the e-positive gamete until the necessary hormones are secreted. The selection of the gamete occurs randomly (as the `esiʈi` may have been inseminated by multiple partners at this point). The e-negative gametes remain the organ for a few days, before they are absorbed into the `esiʈi`'s body. It is also possible that when the `esiʈi` reaches the necessary level of climax to be fertilized, there are two few gametes to fertilize, although this is highly unlikely. Eggs are produced in batches, mostly of 1-3, rarely 4 or 5, but fertilized eggs are discharged gradually. Once fertilized, the development of the eggs follows a similar pattern to that of the `ajɛsɖɶ` eggs. The incubation period for the eggs remains unchanged: six months if insemination is by an `ajɛsɖɶ` and three months if insemination is by a `ɖiʒiɖi`.

On the other hand, `esiʈi` spray, which contains the necessary e-negative gametes to fertilize other `esiʈi` or `ajɛsɖɶ` follow a similar journey as the negative gametes of `ajɛsɖɶ`. Frequently `esiʈi` spray can be pushed into the partner by `ɖiʒiɖi` partners, but this is a risky maneuver.

The gender of the child is determined by the genetic makeup of the parents. As previously mentioned, the `ajɛsɖɶ` lacks sex chromosomes, while the `ɖiʒiɖi` possesses a Y chromosome. In contrast, the `esiʈi` possesses an X chromosome. In general, the X chromosome dominates over the Y chromosome or the absence of chromosomes. There are three variants of `esiʈi`: an `esiʈi` with a single X chromosome is referred to as an omega `esiʈi`, while an `esiʈi` with a single X and single Y chromosome is known as a beta `esiʈi`. Although the differences between an `esiʈi` and an omega or beta `esiʈi` at birth are minimal, upon reaching maturity, an omega `esiʈi` may exhibit symmastic breasts, while a beta `esiʈi` may have a slender physique and larger breasts.

When two pure `esiʈi` mate, the resulting child will always be a pure `esiʈi`. When a pure `esiʈi` mates with an `ajɛsɖɶ`, the resulting child will always be an omega `esiʈi`. If a pure `esiʈi` mates with a pure `ɖiʒiɖi`, the child will be a beta `esiʈi`. In the case of a pure `esiʈi` mating with an omega `ɖiʒiɖi`, there is a 50% chance the child will be either a beta or omega `esiʈi`. When an omega `esiʈi` and an `ajɛsɖɶ` procreate, there is a 50% chance the child will be an omega `esiʈi` or an `ajɛsɖɶ`. If an omega `esiʈi` mates with a pure `ɖiʒiɖi`, there is a 50% chance the child will be a beta `esiʈi` or an omega `ɖiʒiɖi`. When an omega `esiʈi` and an omega `ɖiʒiɖi` mate, there is a 25% chance the child will be an `ajɛsɖɶ`, an omega `ɖiʒiɖi`, or a beta or omega `esiʈi`. In the case of a beta `esiʈi` and an `ajɛsɖɶ` procreating, there is a 50% chance the child will be either an omega `esiʈi` or an omega `ɖiʒiɖi`. If a beta `esiʈi` mates with a pure `ɖiʒiɖi`, there is a 50% chance the child will be either a beta `esiʈi` or a pure `ɖiʒiɖi`. Finally, if a beta `esiʈi` and an omega `ɖiʒiɖi` mate, there is a 25% chance of the child being a beta or omega `esiʈi`, or a 25% chance of the child being an omega or pure `ɖiʒiɖi`.

    The care of a child once hatched is usually given to the father. `esiʈi` are the only gender not capable of producing milk, thus nursing is also the responsibility of the father. Weaning of an `esiʈi` child happens much later than even a `ɖiʒiɖi` child, although technically, an `esiʈi` child is not weaned in the normal sense as they are dependent on the milk of their father. Culturally, before becoming an adult or before marriage, an `esiʈi` is dependent on the milk of their father. After marriage, an `esiʈi` has to look towards the milk of their mates. 


.. rubric:: Development

The developmental trajectory of a `zea ʈeaθyɖa esiʈi` bears resemblances to that of an `ajɛsɖɶ` or `ɖiʒiɖi`. With an average lifespan ranging between 100 and 140 years, albeit potentially shorter due to their inherently violent nature and purpose, the `esiʈi` undergoes a series of milestones and transformations. Notably, at infancy, an `esiʈi` does not possess `ajɛstɹaɹi`. Within the first year, the child acquires the ability to sit up and crawl, while by the age of two, they achieve ambulation and comprehension of simple commands. This stage also marks the emergence of person recognition, basic language skills, and the eruption of primary teeth, accompanied by weight gain. By three years of age, the `esiʈi` demonstrates the capability to run, construct sentences beyond three words, and express desires, further enhancing their physical force.

At the age of five, most of the primary teeth have emerged, and successful toilet training is achieved. Subsequently, fat diminishes while the child's nutritional needs expand beyond milk. Social development becomes more pronounced around the age of seven, encompassing the formation of relationships beyond immediate family ties. Concurrently, formal education commences, encompassing reading and writing skills. Physically, the `esiʈi` acquires the bodily proportions characteristic of their species but does not attain their full stature during this phase.

Upon reaching the age of 12, the `esiʈi` initiates the development of `ajɛstɹaɹi`, a process that culminates by the age of 15 in terms of proportional size relative to height. At 17 years, the `esiʈi` reaches a stage of significant maturity, marked by the emergence of breast development. By 19 years, puberty concludes, with fully developed breasts and sexual organs. At this point, the `esiʈi` attains the ability to give birth.

Between the ages of 19 and 40, the `esiʈi` enters a phase equivalent to young adulthood in humans. Unlike the static development observed in `ajɛsɖɶ` or `ɖiʒiɖi`, the `esiʈi` continues to experience growth during this period, characterized by muscle development and increased size. Furthermore, the production of a specialized protein that confers advantages to the `esiʈi` begins within this timeframe. Subsequently, from 41 to 120 years, the `esiʈi` enjoys a fully vital body capable of diverse capabilities. Beyond this age, signs of aging manifest, including skin laxity, tooth weakening, graying or loss of hair, and muscle deterioration.
