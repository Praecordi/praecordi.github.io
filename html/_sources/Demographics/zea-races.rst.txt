        The new system is the ``XY`` system. This results in a 20\% `ɖiʒiɖi`, 68\% `esiʈi` and 12\% `ajɛsɖɶ`. In these there are 3 types of `esiʈi` -- pure (XX; 18.8\%), beta (XY; 21.5\%), omega (XO; 28.2%) -- and 2 types of `ɖiʒiɖi` -- pure (YY; 5.4\%) and omega (YO; 14.8%) -- but only pure a `ajɛsɖɶ` (OO; 11.3\%).

        With this new system, the `esiʈi` can mate with each other. Because the `esiʈi` have the requirement that they need `ɖiʒiɖi` or `ajɛsɖɶ` milk to survive, the population might be slightly more biased towards `ɖiʒiɖi` and `ajɛsɖɶ`.

    .. rubric:: Physical

    - `ajɛsɖɶ`

      + symmetric face, varied skin and hair color; more aligned with human beauty standards than other genders
      + curvier bodies since they are child-bearers; 
      + short `ajɛstɹaɹi`; ends with neural hair
      + symmastic breasts; can secrete milk

    - `ɖiʒiɖi`

      + ethereal, mystical appearance; focus on lunar symbolism (pale skin, silver hair, glowing eyes)
      + slim and lean bodies; shorter than `ajɛsɖɶ`
      + long `ajɛstɹaɹi`; ends with penis head without duct
      + large breasts which can be aroused; can secrete milk

    - `esiʈi`

      + radiant and fiery appearance; focus on solar symbolism (golden skin, red hair, blazing eyes)
      + curvier bodies since they are also child-bearers; less curvy than `ajɛsɖɶ`, but larger
      + long `ajɛstɹaɹi`; ends with hair
      + small breasts which can be aroused
