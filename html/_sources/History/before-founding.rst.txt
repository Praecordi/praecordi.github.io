Before Founding
===============

The history of the `aɖasi` starts in another universe. `ajɛseɖi` comes from the civilization called `aθɶs`. Although we shall not delve into the specifics of `aθɶs`, we shall reveal just enough to understand the history of `aɖasi`.

Origin
------
`aθɶs` is a region of city-states with a culture oriented towards war and conquest. Each city-state is ruled by a noble family with the same name as the city. While a city changing its name is not an uncommon sight, many conquerers have been wed into a noble family to adopt the name of the conquered. And even then, the previous ruling family is ousted at best, killed at worst.

.. sidebar:: `ajɛseɖi`'s Birth Date

    `ajɛseɖi` exact birth date is not known, and even if it was, it would difficult to calculate when it falls in terms of `aɖasi` time. Thus, `ajɛseɖi` birthdate is celebrated as the day she landed on `aɖasi`.

We start with the birth of `ajɛseɖi`. `ajɛseɖi` is born of a woman named `ðœdɛ`. `ðœdɛ` was a noblewoman of a ruling family named `jyʋi`. `ajɛseɖi` is born of wedlock to an unknown father. Nevertheless, `ajɛseɖi` grows up as an heir to the family, and is trained in the art of war and politics. When `ajɛseɖi` is the equivalent of 20 years of age, `ajɛseɖi`'s home city is attacked by a warlord named `øθysa ʋeʃjœ`. The city is razed to the ground and the `jyʋi` family is killed by the crazed warlord, but `ajɛseɖi` and her mother `ðœdɛ` are spared. They are taken to the city `ʋeʃjœ`, the primary city of `øθysa`. They are introduced to a `ʋeʃja` named `yʋɛɹia` in `øθysa`'s household. `yʋɛɹia` has a daughter named `stɹai`\ [#strais-father]_ who is of the age to be sent to the *Academy Courtesan*. 

While `øθysa` had spared `ðœdɛ` so she could give birth to a potential heir to rule over `jyʋi`, `ajɛseɖi` was a large liability as she would be considered an heir first. And yet `øθysa` was stricken by the young and beautiful `ajɛseɖi`. To counteract this dilemma, `øθysa` sent `ajɛseɖi` with `stɹai` to the famed *Academy* at `ʋeʃjœ` despite being older than the requisite age. Her status changed status as a `ʋeʃja` would invalidate her status as ruler of `jyʋi`, or at least make her hated enough that those in the city would not accept her as their ruler.

The Academy Courtesan
---------------------

The *Academy Courtesan*, the crowning jewel of the city of `ʋeʃjœ`, was a school trained to produce the best of the worst, prostitutes. In `ʋeʃjœ`, much like other `aθɶs` cities, prostitution was considered distasteful, all the while being extremely popular. Prostitutes did not receive much respect, yet the highly regulated profession had many restrictions on who could enter, and the best ones gained much fame.

    Types of Prostitutes in `aθɶs`
    ^^^

    There are two types of prostitutes: those who provide carnal pleasure as a service in exchange for money, and the trained `ʋeʃja`, graduated from the *Academy* to be the perfect companion. `ʋeʃja` are trained not only the art of giving (and properly receiving) pleasure, but also art, music and conversation. Trained `ʋeʃja` do not sell their service, but are leased (often permenantly or for a very long time) from the *Academy*. They can be sold, but only to temples as sacred prostitutes. Nevertheless, both a lowly prostitute and a `ʋeʃja` are considered equal in many regards and distasteful to the general populace.

    See :ref:`this section<notes:on levels of seniority in the academy courtesan>` for more information on the structure of *Academy* education.

The school education begins fairly early. Girls around 18 years of age begin their training in the arts, while being trained to relinquish any societal modesty. Novices are educated fairly well, learning to read and write, with a focus on poetry and art. After 2 years, they become Trainees who are trained in more sexual arts, as well as eloquent oration and rhetoric. After spending a year as a Trainee, girls fail and become normal prostitutes or remain a Trainee at their own expense (which is rare). At 18 years of age, Accepted spend a year training for a specialization in their artistic endeavor, and another year in observation of either lowly *Academy* prostitutes (the *Academy* maintains its own brothel), or temple prostitutes. Completing an examination of their skills allow them to become a `ʋeʃja`. Once a year, the services of old `ʋeʃja` are renewed or resold. In these same auctions, the new `ʋeʃja` are also commissioned to patrons or temples, but for these new `ʋeʃja` this auction is more important as not only their services, but their virginity are sold, occasionally separately, but it is not uncommon for a `ʋeʃja`'s virginity and services to go to two different people.

This is where `ajɛseɖi` arrived. Upon entering the *Academy* most girls are given a Trainee mentor. `ajɛseɖi` is paired with a Trainee mentor named `eɹaʈɛ`, who is assigned with another Novice named `saeθa`. This period is especially difficult for `ajɛseɖi`, since her strict, noble, and conservative upbringing makes it difficult to acclimate herself to the new climate. It wasn't only `ajɛseɖi` who encountered this difficulty, but so did `saeθa` who also had a fairly sheltered upbringing. The two were able to overcome this difficult together, shedding their anxiety with their sense of modesty, while retaining their confidence.

A little about `saeθa`: `saeθa` is the daughter of a prostitute, `ʋiʃetja`, who failed her Trainee examination at the *Academy*. Even so, `ʋiʃetja` had always been ashamed of her position and kept `saeθa` uninformed of her position in society until the day she was sent to the *Academy*. Because of her fairly sheltered upbringing by `ʋiʃetja`. Both `ajɛseɖi` and `saeθa` were inseparable in the *Academy*. 

As `ajɛseɖi` moved on to becoming a Trainee, `stɹai` joined the *Academy* as a Novice, and was assigned to `ajɛseɖi`. She is also the only Novice assigned to `ajɛseɖi`. Since `stɹai` has been conditioned not only by her mother, but the other `ʋeʃja` in service of `øθysa`, `stɹai` has a much easier time transitioning into the *Academy*. This allows `stɹai` to much better focus on her other aspects of her time as a Novice. With the help of `ajɛseɖi`, she is able to excel as a Novice and becomes a Trainee a year earlier. 

As `ajɛseɖi` becomes an Accepted, `stɹai` is once again paired with `ajɛseɖi` as a Trainee-Accepted pair. Although they had some mild moments as a Trainee mentor, `ajɛseɖi` and `stɹai` were required to have plenty of intimate moments, and as such became very attached to each other. At the same time, she also maintained her friendship with `saeθa`. All the while `eɹaʈɛ` becomes a full `ʋeʃja` and is bought by the Temple of the Primal Weaver. The Primal Weaver are a little known sect of forest-dwelling monks who follow the goddess known as the Primal Weaver. The recently growing sect of Primal Weavers had only gained enough followers to afford a `ʋeʃja`.

Throughout her time in the *Academy*, `ajɛseɖi` stays aloof, maintaining her relationship with `eɹaʈɛ` and `saeθa`, and later `stɹai`. But there is one who vehemently dislikes `ajɛseɖi`: a girl of the same age as `ajɛseɖi`, `yʈaʃø`. Competition was encouraged in the *Academy*. As such, different groups would form in the future `ʋeʃja` who would compete for privileges and attention, which was encouraged by mistresses and wardens. Despite `saeθa`'s insistence of playing this game of politics, `ajɛseɖi` was never part of any schemes, and yet because of her natural intelligence and charisma was always able to thawrt any plan by anyone. `yʈaʃø` the leader of a gang of girls played a prank on `ajɛseɖi` whereby she was humiliated in front of not only the other students but the Matron of the *Academy*\ [#ayasedis-embarrassment]_. Although it wasn't the humiliation in its entirety which cause so much anger to `saeθa` and `stɹai`, they decided to retaliate against `yʈaʃø` for this. `saeθa` and `stɹai`, along with some other girls, decided to tie up `yʈaʃø` and place her on the punishment stand, right outside the quarters of one of `yʈaʃø`'s favorite mistresses. As such, she was used by other Accepted, as well as some Trainee's and even mistresses. This caused her intense humiliation, and from here seeds of hatred against `ajɛseɖi` grew in `yʈaʃø`, despite `ajɛseɖi` lack of involvement in this incident. 

After this incident, `yʈaʃø` was always on a lookout to retaliate against `ajɛseɖi` some way. One was by having `stɹai` fail her Trainee exam. `øθysa` refused to have `stɹai` continue another year as a Trainee, and so `stɹai` was forced to become a prostitute at the *Academy* brothel. `ajɛseɖi` and `saeθa` went on to become an Accepted. Occasionally, during this time, `ajɛseɖi` is assigned to `stɹai` during her services, as is customary for second year Accepted. `ajɛseɖi` and `stɹai` grow even closer, and although they had a close and physical relationship until now, this was when `ajɛseɖi` and `stɹai` confessed about falling in love.

This is a cause for multiple problems. Besides the primary one that an Accepted cannot have sex with the prostitute she is observing, `aθɶs` society has a complicated, but strict guidelines on homosexual tendencies. While sex between those of the same gender is allowed, and extra-marital sex between a nobles wife and his `ʋeʃja` mistress is considered fine, a non-carnal loving relationship between two people of the same sex is not allowed. This type of relationship is difficult to detect, and so this accusation is easily misused. 

There were two people who knew of this secret. `saeθa` had known from the beginning as `ajɛseɖi`'s confidant, and assured them that their secret was safe with her. On the other hand, `ajɛseɖi`'s evil shadow suspected of this, but never had any evidence to introduce against `ajɛseɖi`. And she did not dare accuse her of this as `ajɛseɖi` was favored among the *Academy*. Thus `ajɛseɖi` and `stɹai` continue their new relation in secrecy until the following year when `ajɛseɖi` becomes a `ʋeʃja`.

`øθysa`'s Employment
--------------------

At the auction, `ajɛseɖi` is bought by `øθysa`. This had been expected as `øθysa` had been stricken by `ajɛseɖi`'s beauty from her capture of `jyʋi`, and now that her succession to `jyʋi` had been invalidated, could safely keep her. `ajɛseɖi` joined `øθysa`'s household as part of the large entourage of concubines she already had. While most of `øθysa`'s concubines were captured women, `ajɛseɖi` joined the 3 `ʋeʃja` in `øθysa`'s household. As `øθysa`'s mistress, it was `ajɛseɖi`'s duty to pleasure `øθysa` in bed in any way she liked. She also occasionally entertained noble guests of `øθysa`, but was strictly forbidden by `øθysa` to become pregnant. 

It must be noted that after leaving `ʋeʃjœ`, `øθysa` spent several years in conquest. `øθysa` used `ajɛseɖi` very tactfully during this time. Among `øθysa`'s entourage, and even her other `ʋeʃja`, `ajɛseɖi` was easily `øθysa`'s most favored `ʋeʃja`. `øθysa` did not like to send `ajɛseɖi` out to entertain her allies, but did use her when their allies were with her. `ajɛseɖi` mostly participated in various group activities, and was reluctantly shared during this time. Thus `ajɛseɖi` was fairly sheltered of many horrors her fellow `ʋeʃja` experienced when going out. 

After 7 years `øθysa` returned from her conquest to `jyʋi`\ [#year-breakdown]_ where `ajɛseɖi` was reunited with her mother. The noblewoman had been installed as temporary ruler over `jyʋi`. `ðœdɛ` had worked for the 7 years to rebuild the razed `jyʋi` while entertaining and working with `øθysa`'s allies. One such ally were the `sayɹeʃʈe`, a warrior clan from an allied city nearby. With `ajɛseɖi` removed from the `jyʋi` succession line being a `ʋeʃja`, `øθysa` ordered `ðœdɛ` to have a child with the guest `ɹœʃɹa sayɹeʃʈe`. `ðœdɛ` bore a daughter, named `θisœʈe`, unbeknownst to `ɹœʃɹa`. While `θisœʈe` would not inherit anything from `sayɹeʃʈe`, her combined royal blood would make her eligible to rule over `jyʋi`.

Besides `θisœʈe`, `øθysa` had in her household another child of `ɹœʃɹa`, named `saiʃeʈa`. Born of `ɹœʃɹa` and his concubine `seʈa`, `saiʃeʈa` was raised to be a general for `ɹœʃɹa` legitimate children. In being allied to `øθysa`, `ɹœʃɹa` had sent `saiʃeʈa` as a gift to `øθysa`\ [#othysa-household]_. `øθysa` did not care much for `saiʃeʈa` and was assigned by `øθysa` to guard her entourage, which included her `ʋeʃja` and other concubines. `saiʃeʈa` resolved to accept this role. 

The next 3 years, `øθysa` would remain at `jyʋi`, ruling over the city through `ðœdɛ`. `øθysa` gave the responsibility of raising `θisœʈe` to her entourage, and subsequently `ajɛseɖi`. Although being an illegitimate half-sister, `ajɛseɖi` and `saiʃeʈa` were happy to take care of `θisœʈe`. During this time `θisœʈe` would grow to be 9 years old. But not all was well in these 3 years. `ðœdɛ` would see first hand how `øθysa` would use her daughter. `ðœdɛ` and `ajɛseɖi` daughter is complicated during this time. While overcome with love for her daughter, `ðœdɛ` is also disappointed by what her daughter has become, regardless of the fact that it was unintentional and forced. Over the 3 years, `ðœdɛ`'s disappointment is slowly replaced with a helpless anger against `øθysa`.

Moreover, during these 3 years, `øθysa`'s twisted nature showed to the fullest extent. She had a strange obsession with incest. She would frequently use `ðœdɛ` in bed, a prerogative she got as a conquerer and she liberally used. And immediately after, she would have `ajɛseɖi`, `ðœdɛ`'s daughter, service her. Another way this obsession would come out was through `saiʃeʈa`. Since `saiʃeʈa` was half-sister of `θisœʈe` from her father's side, and `ajɛseɖi` was half-sister of `θisœʈe` from her mother's side, in a way `saiʃeʈa` and `ajɛseɖi` would be considered sisters. `øθysa` found enjoyment in forcing `ajɛseɖi` to pleasure `saiʃeʈa` in a relationship which was almost incestual, but not quite.

Fall of `øθysa`
---------------

Despite the advise of her generals to move out of `jyʋi` and return to her name city `ʋeʃjœ`, `øθysa` stayed in `jyʋi` for 3 years, and planned to remain a fourth year. `ðœdɛ`'s resentment had slowly started to build, and she took advantage of `øθysa`'s laxity to go behind her back to the `sayɹeʃʈe`. `ðœdɛ` makes a deal with `ɹœʃɹa` which would allow her to retain `jyʋi`, and free `ajɛseɖi` from bondage, in return for a chance to get rid of `øθysa` and kill `θisœʈe`. Thus `ðœdɛ` allows `sayɹeʃʈe` soldiers into `jyʋi` who immediately attack `øθysa`. The fierce warlord fought, but was ultimate overwhelmed. 

Once the attack is over, the `sayɹeʃʈe` soldiers stay in `jyʋi` to "help establish itself after the battle". Unfortunately, `ɹœʃɹa` had been deposed by members of his own family who attempt to renege on the agreement made by `ɹœʃɹa`. `ðœdɛ` found out, and attempted to rouse `jyʋi` soldiers to drive away the now invading `sayɹeʃʈe` force, but was unsuccessful. She helped `saiʃeʈa` escape with the `ʋeʃja` as well as `θisœʈe`\ [#dhodas-fate]_. Unfortunately most of the other `ʋeʃja` are captured. 

While `saiʃeʈa` suggested to return to `ʋeʃjœ`, `ajɛseɖi` was reluctant to do so. After `øθysa`'s death, she was obligated to return herself back to the Academy, but `ajɛseɖi` did not wish to do so. `saiʃeʈa` assures her that the Academy wouldn't be able to get to `ajɛseɖi` and decides to travel to `ʋeʃjœ`. Upon reaching `ʋeʃjœ`, they see a devastated city, as a branch of the `sayɹeʃʈe` army has placed the city on seige while inside, the power vacuum from `øθysa`'s death has caused a power struggle from `øθysa`'s remaining generals, but also the Academy's new matron `yʈaʃø`, who had risen to become the leader of the Academy. Members of the Academy recognized `ajɛseɖi` in `ʋeʃjœ`. When this news reached `yʈaʃø`, she determined to finally exact revenge on her nemesis, and sent soldiers to reclaim her. `ajɛseɖi` is captured by the Academy soldiers, and `yʈaʃø` keeps her locked on Academy grounds\ [#utashos-plans]_. Upon `ajɛseɖi`'s capture, she seeks out `stɹai` to torture `ajɛseɖi` ever further. The two are united in a horrible situation. Fortunately, `saiʃeʈa` is able to find where `ajɛseɖi` is captured and free them. They immediately escape the city, bringing along `stɹai` with them.


The Forest of the Primal Weaver
-------------------------------

From `ʋeʃjœ`, `ajɛseɖi`, `saiʃeʈa`, `θisœʈe` and `stɹai` decide to travel to the Forest of the Primal Weaver, where both `eɹaʈɛ` and `saeθa` reside. This journey itself is dangerous as `yʈaʃø` sends a contingent of soldiers to recapture `ajɛseɖi`\ [#random-note1]_. Safety is found in a most unlikely situation. The group of 3 encountered a gang of bandits, runaway bannerless soldiers from various armies who had chosen to use their skill to steal. Since there was nothing worth stealing from them, the group was mostly spared, but `ajɛseɖi` and `saiʃeʈa` were able to negotiate terms\ [#deal-caveat]_, allowing them to travel with the gang. This managed to scare the Academy soldiers away, but also kept them safe from other more dangerous bandits.

Eventually, the group separates from the bandits at the outskirts of the Forest of the Primal Weaver. Some information on the Primal Weaver: the Cult of the Primal Weaver, as it was called in `aθɶs` during that time, was well known, but not well considered. Most considered the followers of the Primal Weaver as dillusional, crazy, and savage. While the Cult of the Primal Weaver was relatively new, it was only new as an organization. Followers of the Primal Weaver had been living in the forest for centuries.

    About the Cult of the Primal Weaver
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    The cult was based on a goddess whose epithet was "The Primal Weaver", though among her oldest and closest followers, she was called `seɹikani`. To understand the cult of `seɹikani`, we must understand the goddess herself. She is a playful, but wise goddess, one who walks amongst the various primates in the forest she calls home. She is a masterful weaver, able to make beautiful tapestries from threads made from leaves, vines, and sometimes her own hair, colored using the various ingredients found in the jungle. Her followers believe the world to be a massive tapestry which the goddess is constantly weaving. Many of the cult members are proficient weavers themselves, whose works are highly sought after on the rest of the continent. 

    The majority of the Primal Weaver live in the middle of the forest in a small city named `aɹinka`. `aɹinka` was an engineering marvel. Although buildings in `aɹinka` were created from baked mud, wood, grass and leaves, these buildings were built without harming any trees. Built not on the ground but on the trees themselves, the trees were rarely cut into, but rather used as supports. Branches were guided into specific spots to support buildings, an excellent network of ladders and stairs would lead a person to the top of the city. An ingenious system of sewage and waterwork was used to provide for the people. The only buildings built on the ground were homes for the old, or the Temple of the Primal Weaver where `eɹaʈɛ` and `saeθa` worked.

    While many religious sects on `aθɶs` provided `ʋeʃja` service in the temples, the Temple of the Primal Weaver was different. Large or rich temples in `aθɶs` maintained one or more `ʋeʃja` in their temples for religious ceremonies, as well as some other prostitutes. Although temples discouraged extra marital sex, they provided outlets such as the `ʋeʃja` and the other sacred prostitutes to have religiously safe sex. While sex outside of a marriage was strictly forbidden, since these `ʋeʃja` were a religious servants, they could be used freely. Additionally, this service could be used to fund the temple. Another important distinction is that temple `ʋeʃja` were restricted to rich patrons and followers, while other prostitutes were provided for the rest of the followers. The Temple of the Primal Weaver only had `ʋeʃja`, and moreover, they were used not in a public manner, but as a role in religious ceremonies to the goddess. 

    The Primal Weaver is believed to be a rather promiscuous, curious goddess by nature. The followers of the Primal Weaver believed sex to be the most effective way to be closer to the goddess. Large festivals and celebrations contained a religious segment were such sex was encouraged. But most importantly, during religious events, monks of the Primal Weaver would engage in a sacred union to bring themselves closer to the goddess. Before the `ʋeʃja`, this duty was taken upon by one woman, who was rendered unmarried when she took upon the role. She was selected and anointed by the monks to become the vessel, and would be used as such until the goddess retired her. As the sect became larger, and `aɹinka` grew, the cult leaders sought to buy a `ʋeʃja` from the Academy to gain this duty. `eɹaʈɛ` was the first of the Weaver's formal sacred prostitute. `saeθa` would become the second. Only 2 such prostitutes were maintained. 

    Upon the introduction of the `ʋeʃja`, the role of the sacred prostitute was expanded upon. While sacred unions happened only during religious events, the common men were free to use the `ʋeʃja` during specific times of the day. Selected by lot, these common unions was a matter of pride for ordinary citizens and would be considered a special event for the common citizen. No transactions were made and both men and women were allowed. Most of these common unions were also held publicly, unless specifically requested by the sacred prostitute herself. The `ʋeʃja` in these vents (and in general) were treated with utmost respect, unlike their counterparts in the other temples. They were considered outlets of the Primal Weaver, second only to her in religious matters (sometimes above even the monks).

    Because of their free views on sex, and their general "savage" ways in the eyes of the other `aθɶs` religions and religious sects, the cult of the Primal Weaver is general considered dillusional, crazy, and savage. 

.. sidebar::
    
    `ajɛseɖi` has mentioned that some more time at `aɹinka` and she would have converted into a follower of `seɹikani`.

When `ajɛseɖi`, `saiʃeʈa`, `θisœʈe`, and `stɹai` reached `aɹinka`, they were welcomed with open arms. The group was allowed to live in the temple with the other ordained `ʋeʃja`, and soon enough participated in the many rituals of the Primal Weaver. Here, we also mention that in her role as the sacred prostitute, `saeθa` had given birth to 3 children\ [#cpw-view-on-pregnancies]_: the oldest, `seθi`, the middle, `aʃaða`, and the youngest, `teʃi`. 

`seθi` was the 5 years old and `aʃaða` had turned 3. `teʃi` was a newborn, `saeθa` having just given birth to him a little before `ajɛseɖi`, `saiʃeʈa`, `θisœʈe` and `stɹai` arrived.

The group spent about 3 years in `aɹinka`, where the details of their lives were mostly uneventful. There were three major events which are worth mentioning, the last of which initiates the beginning of `aɖasi` as we know it. 

Upon arriving in `aɹinka`, `saiʃeʈa` falls in love with a young monk named `ɖi`. While they do not get married, in a few months in they conceive a child. Around a year in staying in `aɹinka`, `saiʃeʈa` gives birth to, not one, but two children: twins named `dea` and `θea`.

Around a year and a half after staying in `aɹinka`, `saiʃeʈa` attempted to participate in the common union at the playful urges of `ajɛseɖi`. Not expecting to be selected, `saiʃeʈa` agreed. By random chance, `saiʃeʈa` was selected, and to her embarrassment had to participate in the public event with `eɹaʈɛ`. As a playful revenge, `saiʃeʈa` arranged for `ajɛseɖi` to be placed in the lots as well. And again by some miracle, `ajɛseɖi` was selected as well. `ajɛseɖi` slept with `saeθa`. The two `ʋeʃja` put on such a display that by the end the crowd was sweating in the cold month. The union was so powerful that the Primal Weaver herself made an appearance after decades, granting `saeθa` and `ajɛseɖi` a sweet kiss on the forehead and the crowd a surprise audience before returning. Although such an event did not happen again, `ajɛseɖi` was made an honorable monk, and made to perform the sacred union multiple times after that.

Unfortunately, this had to end. Two years after first arriving in `aɹinka` (half a year after the audience by `seɹikani`) the succession war in `ʋeʃjœ` was over, and `yʈaʃø` had claimed the name of the city for herself. She got wind of `ajɛseɖi`'s location and fabricated a reason to send a contingent of soldiers to `aɹinka`. The soldiers arrived in `aɹinka` and attempted to arrest `ajɛseɖi`. The followers refused to give up the now sacred woman, and thus the soldiers attacked. In this ensueing panick `saiʃeʈa`'s mate, `ɖi`, is killed. Once again finding themselves in the middle of a situation, `saiʃeʈa` rushed `ajɛseɖi` deeper into the forest. `saeθa` accompanied them to help, but they were surrounded by soldiers. In a desperate attempt, `saeθa` kissed `ajɛseɖi`, calling `seɹikani`. `seɹikani` explained that she could eliminate the soldiers and even defeat the entire army `yʈaʃø` had sent, but even so, `ajɛseɖi` would be placing many lives in danger. She explained that a better solution would be to disappear from `aθɶs` completely, making `yʈaʃø` believe she was dead. `ajɛseɖi` agreed, and `seɹikani` sent `ajɛseɖi` to the planet she knew was habitable, and filled with goddesses who would accept the three.

.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#strais-father] `yʋɛɹia`'s daughter, `stɹai`, is not the daughter of `øθysa`, since human females cannot produce a child together. So if `yʋɛɹia` is `øθysa`'s, then how does she have a child? `øθysa` offered her `ʋeʃja`'s services to her enemies as truce, and would force her to have their child, thereby giving her a sort of leverage against her enemies. Thus `stɹai` is a child of `yʋɛɹia` and an unknown noble.

    `stɹai` is 2 years younger than `ajɛseɖi` so has not started her hereditary education at the *Academy*. 

.. [#ayasedis-embarrassment] During an endurance examination, `yʈaʃø` sneaked aphrodisiac onto `ajɛseɖi`'s drink which caused her to fail in the examination. This examination was attended by the then Matron of the *Academy* by chance. Although this event was later found out, and `ajɛseɖi`'s failure was rescinded, this event was particularly memorable because the dosage of the aphrodisiac was too high and caused sever sensory pain to `ajɛseɖi` for an entire week.

.. [#year-breakdown] 5 years in the *Academy* and 2 year on the campaign. 

.. [#othysa-household] `øθysa` had also subsequently sent such a gift to `ɹœʃɹa`, besides `ðœdɛ`. `øθysa` had sent a child of her own, whose name is not important. 

    We have not spoken in detail of `øθysa`'s household. The ruling family of an `aθɶs` city is quite large. `øθysa` while being a matriarch could only have one husband, unlike family patriarchs who could have multiple wives and concubines. `øθysa` had very few children of her known, being a warrior first and mother later. Rather `øθysa` had a large amount of female concubines and at least 5 `ʋeʃja`. Her husband would freely use the concubines to his liking, but was limited in his usage of the `ʋeʃja` unless he was allowed by `øθysa`.
    
.. [#dhodas-fate] `ðœdɛ` suffers a rather gruesome fate after wherein she is captured by `sayɹeʃʈe` soldiers and is used freely. She later kills herself by jumping into a large firepit. Fortunately, `ajɛseɖi` is spared this sight, and believes her mother died honorably by poisoning herself. 

.. [#utashos-plans] It is unclear what `yʈaʃø` was ultimately planning on doing with `ajɛseɖi`. Most think she was waiting for her to win the succession of `ʋeʃjœ` before resolving this matter. It is known that `yʈaʃø` did not completely forget about imprisoning `ajɛseɖi` as she tortured `ajɛseɖi` during the time she was there. 

.. [#random-note1] The leader of this contingent is also incredulous as to why this mission is so important. `yʈaʃø` is steeped in hatred over `ajɛseɖi`.

.. [#deal-caveat] As one expects, the gang did not do this for free. The leaders recognized `ajɛseɖi` and `stɹai`'s occupations, and would regularly use them at night. `ajɛseɖi` was able to negotiate usage by only the leadership of the gang, and not the more rough, lowly soldiers. Occasionally, `saiʃeʈa` is also forced to participate. 

.. [#cpw-view-on-pregnancies] The view of the followers of the Primal Weaver on pregnancy, especially on the sacred prostitute, was very favorable. Many previous sacred prostitutes had been retired due to pregnancy, especially those conceived during a sacred union. Pregnancies during common unions was also possible and still accepted. 

   `saeθa`'s 3 children were all conceived during a sacred union. Although it is difficult to ascertain who exactly the father is, based on appearance, the primary consensus is `seθi` and `aʃaða` were fathered by the prime monk of the Primal Weaver, `œlðay`, while `teʃi` is fathered young monk, `œlʈas`. Unlike previous sacred prostitutes, `saeθa` was not permenantly retired upon her pregnancy, but took a furlough from her responsibilities, during which she was still provided for by the temple.

   Unfortunately, `eɹaʈɛ` was never able to give birth to a child, most likely due to some natural defect.
