                I think we can change some of `ajɛseɖi`'s storyline. The idea is that `ajɛseɖi` is a princess of a nation which is conquered. `ðœdɛ`, who is the queen, is forced into being a lowly prostitute, and `ajɛseɖi` as a prostitute's daughter is sent to the *Academy Courtesan* (at a much older age than others; this could also be why she falls in love with the older `stɹai`) where her story proceeds as usual. 
                
                `saiʃeʈa`'s storyline can remain the same. Her education in clothing can be advantageous in the new magic system.
                
                I like the idea of a main character not being special (i.e. a noble or queen). Changing the story from `ajɛseɖi` being born into prostitution to being born as a princess and then going into prostitution changes that. Thus I want to have `saeθa` have that storyline instead. When `ajɛseɖi` enters the *Academy Courtesan*, she is put under `eɹaʈɛ`, and also meets the younger Novice `saeθa`.
                
                When `ajɛseɖi` graduates, she is hired by `øθysa`, while both `saeθa` and `eɹaʈɛ` become temple prostitutes. When `øθysa` falls this is where `ajɛseɖi` and `saiʃeʈa` goes with `θisœʈe`.

                Need to change the story for the First Arrival. Maybe `ajɛseɖi` did not come alone, but came with `saiʃeʈa` and `saeθa`?

                The Ranthis storylines can change a little bit. Completely reword `ajɛseɖi`'s Ranthis storyline. `saeθa` and `seθi`'s storyline is good. Keep it as is. Same for `θisœʈe` and `stɹai`. Rework `saiʃeʈa`, `θea` and `teʃi`'s storyline.

                By far the longest of the timelines. We need to show the rise of the `isiʈeθɶ` and properly develop how they adopted and used the magic. Their primary fight is with the Moon Dynasty, who still has `zɛɹa` enslaved.

                The event I'm most excited about, but probably can't get to in a long time. Think about how to approach this after finishing the rest of the events.
