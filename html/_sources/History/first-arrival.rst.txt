Story in `aɖasi`

Story in `aθɶs`
---------------

`ajɛseɖi`, `saeθa` and `saiʃeʈa` disappear after the attack on the `aɹinka`. `stɹai` and `eɹaʈɛ` believe that they are dead and mourn their loss. `stɹai` adopts `θisœʈe`, `dea` and `θea`, while `eɹaʈɛ` adopts `saeθa`'s children. The `ʋeʃjœ` soldiers ravage `aɹinka` leaving little behind. `eɹaʈɛ`, being a `ʋeʃja` having no master since the Temple of the Primal Weaver has been destroyed, is taken back to `ʋeʃjœ`. `stɹai` opts not to return to `ʋeʃjœ` with `eɹaʈɛ` because of the volatile nature of the city, and remains in the country side. She makes her living off of working as a maid, or doing odd jobs. She is careful in returning back to prostitution no matter how desperate on a bid to remain ever faithful to `ajɛseɖi`.

`eɹaʈɛ` is bought by a noble man in `ʋeʃjœ` and she is kept in hopes that she gives birth to a child the wife of the noble man could never give. After 8 years of failure[#eratas-punishments]_, the noble man throws `eɹaʈɛ` out and she returns to the *Academy* as an instructor. In 2 more years, `seθi` joins the *Academy* as a `ʋeʃja`'s daughter. `seθi`, while conditioned for her time in the *Academy*, still has a rough time in the *Academy*, especially as a Novice, studying fine arts. As she moves up to become a Trainee and then Accepted, she becomes much more comfortable, and grows to become an excellent `ʋeʃja`.

`aʃaða` joins the *Academy* as a Novice, when `seθi` is a Trainee, and thus is put in her charge. It may seem a little incestuous, but physical relationship between Novice and Trainee are much milder than those between a Trainee and Accepted. This pair up automatically avoided when `seθi` is an Accepted [#random-note]_. `seθi` is about to become a full `ʋeʃja` and `teʃi` is about to be taken to the *Academy* when `ajɛseɖi`, `saeθa` and `saiʃeʈa` reappear to bring their partners and children to `aɖasi`.

As we briefly mentioned before, `stɹai` works a life of labor in a nearby city primarily filled with refugees from `aɹinka`. She works odd jobs initially, but begins her own bakery at a point in her life. `stɹai` has it particularly rough as she is the target of many rumors, being the sole caretaker of `θisœʈe`, `dea` and `θea`. While most believe that `θisœʈe` is `stɹai`'s sister, or even half-sister, they are convinced that `dea` and `θea` are born out of wedlock. Most women avoid her, and frequently soldiers and bankers would force her. Despite `stɹai`'s insistence, `θisœʈe` chooses not to marry, having grown a disgust of men from their treatment of `stɹai`, and eventually herself. As such, `θisœʈe` starts spending time with the only women who will talk with her: those in the red light district. 

Despite disobeying many of `stɹai`'s words, `θisœʈe` is still close to `stɹai`. And at some point in their life, `θisœʈe` becomes physically attracted to `stɹai` despite their difference in age. `θisœʈe` herself is confused by these thoughts and is hesitant to tell her. 

`stɹai`'s life becomes a little stable, as with her growing age, fewer men made advances on her and left her alone [#why-not-thisote]_. Having grown content in her own solitude and providing for the twins, `stɹai` slowly grows happier. This is when `ajɛseɖi` appears again, throwing `stɹai`'s now steady life back into turbulence.

.. dropdown:: What happens in `aθɶs` while the main 3 are away?

    Although `ajɛseɖi` leaves to protect the Primal Weaver's Forest, the soldiers still destroy `aɹinka`. `stɹai` manages to escape and gain employment with the rest of the residents of `aɹinka`, but `eɹaʈɛ` being a `ʋeʃja` is taken to be resold. `stɹai`, having spent time with `θisœʈe` during the journey as well as being good friends with `saiʃeʈa`, takes cares of `θisœʈe`, `dea`, and `θea`. `seθi`, `aʃaða`, and `teʃi` go with `eɹaʈɛ` to `ʋeʃjœ`.

    .. admonition:: When do `ajɛseɖi`, `saeθa`, and `saiʃeʈa` return?
        :class: question

        I would like there to be enough gap in `ajɛseɖi` and the rest returning that `seθi` becomes a `ʋeʃjœ`, `aʃaða` is still in training. `teʃi` being the youngest of them doesn't join. Given the :doc:`age of the children <timelines>`, it must be about 16 years before `ajɛseɖi` comes back. By then 
        
        - `stɹai` is 45 years
        - `eɹaʈɛ` is 48 years
        - `θisœʈe` is 28 years
        - `seθi` is 23 years
        - `aʃaða` is 21 years
        - `teʃi` is 18 years
        - `dea` and `θea` are 17 years

.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#eratas-punishment] As the years go on, the noble man gets increasingly frustrated. During especially drunken nights, he would have rough and violent sex. In latter years, he visited local apothecaries for herbs to enhance his semen production. It is an irony that `eɹaʈɛ` having adopted `saeθa`'s children was bought by the noble man because of his thought that she was extremely fertile (the 3 being fairly close together in age). `eɹaʈɛ` on her part never revealed that `seθi`, `aʃaða` and `teʃi` were not her children, thinking the noble man would throw them away. At the same time, `eɹaʈɛ` was treated rather horribly by the wife of the noble man who out of jealousy was horrible to her. 

.. [#random-note] It should be noted that if `seθi` and `aʃaða` had been of an age where their Trainee-Accepted relation was possible, this would have been specifically avoided by the *Academy* members as incest was still considered to be taboo. At the same time, the definition of incest is limited to close relationships, such as sisters, and half-sisters (those who share one or both parents), but not cousins.

.. [#why-not-thisote] One can ask, if people made less advances against `stɹai`, then why did they not make them at the younger `θisœʈe`. `θisœʈe` had grown a reputation as a racuous, indulgent, and not particularly feminine woman. Thus most men, if not people, avoided her. Besides working with `stɹai` at the bakery, she would spend her time outside, drinking with the prostitutes, or playing with their children.
