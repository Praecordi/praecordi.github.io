Story in `aɖasi`
----------------

Upon reaching `aɖasi`, then women have a rough time surviving in the wilds. The thinner atmosphere required time to acclimate to, and much of the flora was unknown to the women. While water was abundant, the primary problem was food. Yet :zean-like:`seɹikani` had sent the women to this planet because she had known the goddesses. It wasn't long before the dormant goddesses, now known as the `aiɖi`, awakened because of the newcomers and contacted them.

There were 6 `aiɖi` on the planet during this time. The 4 original `aiɖi` of `aɖasi`, born and tied to the system of `zai`, were `etiaʃi`, `aʃieti`, `iʈʂedy` and `iɖʐe`. `zɛɹa` was an `aiɖi` of foreign origin, but was now an `aiɖi` of `zai` due to the millions of years she had spent here. `seʃɹø`, the last `aiɖi`, is the daughter of `aʃieti` and `iʈʂedy`.

`ajɛseɖi` met `etiaʃi` first in her dreams where the `aiɖi` helped her by showing her viable plants for her consumption. Eventually, `etiaʃi` explains the dilemma of the `aiɖi` in this system. Due to the laws of nature in `zai`, an `aiɖi` can only appear in the Material Plane when called with intention. Thus, the `aiɖi` had attempted many ways to produce an intelligent species with the ability to call the `aiɖi` to the Material Plane, and yet they were largely unsuccessful, instead populating the planet with different kinds of flora. 

`etiaʃi` proposed that if `ajɛseɖi` and the other women helped her in making such viable creatures, she would help her in establishing a safe haven for her family and friends on `aɖasi` away from `aθɶs`. `ajɛseɖi` and the others agreed and `etiaʃi` started to train `ajɛseɖi`, `saiʃeʈa` and `saeθa` in the art of `sʋe`. `etiaʃi`'s sister, `aʃieti` did not agree with this decision and refused to help. On the other hand, `zɛɹa` and `iɖʐe` helped in training `saiʃeʈa` and `saeθa`, while `ajɛseɖi` herself was under the tutelage of `etiaʃi`. `seʃɹø`, caught between the different decisions of her parents as well as nature of creating, largely remained neutral in the training and creation process, but kept tabs on the progress of the women.

After a few months of training, `etiaʃi` and `ajɛseɖi` first initiated the creation of the `zea ʈeaθyɖa` as they decided to call them. `ajɛseɖi` modeled the race after her own body, but also applying several changes to the bodily functions and physical aspect. The creation process, which lasted 5 days and produced about 200 `ʈeaθyɖa`, was successful, but also changed `ajɛseɖi`\ [#ayasedis-changes]_.

The women, as well as the other `aiɖi`, monitored the fledgeling race for a year, noting any irregularities. In a years time, `ajɛseɖi` put down a proposal for two other genders which would accompany the `ajɛsɖɶ` in the areas that they lacked. Thus, `saeθa` with `zɛɹa` designed the `ɖiʒiɖi`, while `saiʃeʈa` with `iɖʐe` designed the `esiʈi`. The other genders were slowly incorporated into the `ajɛsɖɶ` communities. But the women strictly reduced any intervention in the early `ʈeaθyɖa`. At the time, their belief was to let the `ʈeaθyɖa` form their own communities. The `aiɖi` did imbue them with the memory of language on creation, but ideas such as community standards, ideals, and behavior was left to the `ʈeaθyɖa`. 

We must also note some developments to the `aiɖi` population in `zai`. In parts of their studies to learn the `sʋe`, the women had to visit the Ethereal Realm. `etiaʃi`, due to her dormancy as well as her nature, requested `ajɛseɖi` to bed her. As a result of this relationship, `ajɛseɖi` gave birth to an `aiɖi`, `θaœ`, while `etiaʃi` gave birth to `ʃɶða`. But `θaœ` wasn't the only `aiɖi` born during these 5 years in `aɖasi`. The `aiɖi iʈʂedy` foresaw the need for more `aiɖi` in the system, specifically hers, and requested `saiʃeʈa` and `saeθa` to provide her with some. `iʈʂedy` inseminated both `saeθa` and `saiʃeʈa` rather quickly, and returned to her dormancy. In some time, `saiʃeʈa` gave birth to `dœʋa` and `saeθa` to `ʋaðœ`\ [#strange-circumstances]_. 

After the birth of the 4 `aiɖi`, `ajɛseɖi` approached `etiaʃi` to return them back to `aθɶs` so they may return with their families. And thus, she sent `ajɛseɖi`, `saeθa` and `saiʃeʈa` back to `aθɶs`.

Story in `aθɶs`
---------------

`ajɛseɖi`, `saeθa` and `saiʃeʈa` disappear after the attack on the `aɹinka`. `stɹai` and `eɹaʈɛ` believe that they are dead and mourn their loss. `stɹai` adopts `θisœʈe`, `dea` and `θea`, while `eɹaʈɛ` adopts `saeθa`'s children. The `ʋeʃjœ` soldiers ravage `aɹinka` leaving little behind. `eɹaʈɛ`, being a `ʋeʃja` having no master since the Temple of the Primal Weaver has been destroyed, is taken back to `ʋeʃjœ`. `stɹai` opts not to return to `ʋeʃjœ` with `eɹaʈɛ` because of the volatile nature of the city, and remains in the country side. She makes her living off of working as a maid, or doing odd jobs. She is careful in returning back to prostitution no matter how desperate on a bid to remain ever faithful to `ajɛseɖi`.

`eɹaʈɛ` is bought by a noble man in `ʋeʃjœ` and she is kept in hopes that she gives birth to a child the wife of the noble man could never give. After 8 years of failure\ [#eratas-punishments]_, the noble man throws `eɹaʈɛ` out and she returns to the *Academy* as an instructor. In 2 more years, `seθi` joins the *Academy* as a `ʋeʃja`'s daughter. `seθi`, while conditioned for her time in the *Academy*, still has a rough time in the *Academy*, especially as a Novice, studying fine arts. As she moves up to become a Trainee and then Accepted, she becomes much more comfortable, and grows to become an excellent `ʋeʃja`.

`aʃaða` joins the *Academy* as a Novice, when `seθi` is a Trainee, and thus is put in her charge. It may seem a little incestuous, but physical relationship between Novice and Trainee are much milder than those between a Trainee and Accepted. This pair up automatically avoided when `seθi` is an Accepted\ [#random-note]_. `seθi` is about to become a full `ʋeʃja` and `teʃi` is about to be taken to the *Academy* when `ajɛseɖi`, `saeθa` and `saiʃeʈa` reappear to bring their partners and children to `aɖasi`.

As we briefly mentioned before, `stɹai` works a life of labor in a nearby city primarily filled with refugees from `aɹinka`. She works odd jobs initially, but begins her own bakery at a point in her life. `stɹai` has it particularly rough as she is the target of many rumors, being the sole caretaker of `θisœʈe`, `dea` and `θea`. While most believe that `θisœʈe` is `stɹai`'s sister, or even half-sister, they are convinced that `dea` and `θea` are born out of wedlock. Most women avoid her, and frequently soldiers and bankers would force her. Despite `stɹai`'s insistence, `θisœʈe` chooses not to marry, having grown a disgust of men from their treatment of `stɹai`, and eventually herself. As such, `θisœʈe` starts spending time with the only women who will talk with her: those in the unreputed district. 

Despite disobeying many of `stɹai`'s words, `θisœʈe` is still close to `stɹai`. And at some point in their life, `θisœʈe` becomes physically attracted to `stɹai` despite their difference in age. `θisœʈe` herself is confused by these thoughts and is hesitant to tell her. 

`stɹai`'s life becomes a little stable, as with her growing age, fewer men made advances on her and left her alone\ [#why-not-thisote]_. Having grown content in her own solitude and providing for the twins, `stɹai` slowly grows happier. This is when `ajɛseɖi` appears again, throwing `stɹai`'s now steady life back into turbulence.

.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#ayasedis-changes] `ajɛseɖi` was quite surprised by the changes to her body, and in the beginning was not particularly happy about it. She was particularly unwieldy and clumsy with her `ajɛstɹaɹi`, and she was noted to have had a tough time sleeping with them. 

.. [#strange-circumstances] Both `saeθa` and `saiʃeʈa` were quite reluctant with this request. They did not know of `ajɛseɖi`'s relationship with `etiaʃi`, or the fact that she was already pregnant with `θaœ`, and were skeptical of birth in the Ethereal Realm. They were finally convinced partly by `iʈʂedy`'s reluctancy to engage with them, and partly by reassurances by `aʃieti` of the nature of the birth. This relationship was quite loveless, and was over as quickly as it begun. The birth, which mimicked that of human childbirth, happened 9 months later and was delivered by `seʃɹø`.

.. [#eratas-punishments] As the years go on, the noble man gets increasingly frustrated. During especially drunken nights, he would have rough and violent sex. In latter years, he visited local apothecaries for herbs to enhance his semen production. It is an irony that `eɹaʈɛ` having adopted `saeθa`'s children was bought by the noble man because of his thought that she was extremely fertile (the 3 being fairly close together in age). `eɹaʈɛ` on her part never revealed that `seθi`, `aʃaða` and `teʃi` were not her children, thinking the noble man would throw them away. At the same time, `eɹaʈɛ` was treated rather horribly by the wife of the noble man who out of jealousy was horrible to her. 

.. [#random-note] It should be noted that if `seθi` and `aʃaða` had been of an age where their Trainee-Accepted relation was possible, this would have been specifically avoided by the *Academy* members as incest was still considered to be taboo. At the same time, the definition of incest is limited to close relationships, such as sisters, and half-sisters (those who share one or both parents), but not cousins.

.. [#why-not-thisote] One can ask, if people made less advances against `stɹai`, then why did they not make them at the younger `θisœʈe`. `θisœʈe` had grown a reputation as a racuous, indulgent, and not particularly feminine woman. Thus most men, if not people, avoided her. Besides working with `stɹai` at the bakery, she would spend her time outside, drinking with the prostitutes, or playing with their children.
