On Ranthis
==========

When `ajɛseɖi`, `saeθa`, and `saiʃeʈa` return to `aθɶs`, they are surprised with the fact that the Followers of the Primal Weaver had dispersed, and both `eɹaʈɛ` and `stɹai` had split away. `yʈaʃø` on her part has become the de facto leader of `ʋeʃjœ` in all but her name. The three decide to travel to `ʋeʃjœ`, being the biggest city and the most likely place where everyone could be, to gain the whereabouts of `eɹaʈɛ`, `stɹai` and the children. They are careful to hide their altered state. They are able to find `eɹaʈɛ` teaching in the *Academy*. While `eɹaʈɛ` is not able to give the exact whereabouts of `stɹai`, she points them to the right direction. 

`saiʃeʈa` and `ajɛseɖi` head out to find `stɹai`, while `saeθa` stays with `eɹaʈɛ` to explain their discovery. While hesitant to leave with them, `saeθa` convinces her to join them in this new world. `seθi` is soon to become a full `ʋeʃja` while `aʃaða`, an Accepted. This is a problem as the *Academy* is quite serious about keeping their `ʋeʃjœ` and Accepted, specifically their young `ʋeʃjœ`\ [#explanation]. 

On the other hand, `saiʃeʈa` and `ajɛseɖi` spend many weeks tracking down the movement of the Primal Weaver refugees. They are able to track down their movements to a village where they find `stɹai` and `θisœʈe`, alongside `dea` and `θea`. As we noted before, `stɹai`'s life had stabilized. She was taken aback by `saiʃeʈa` and `ajɛseɖi`'s existence, but was conflicted by leaving the life she had settled into. At the same time, `θisœʈe` was not happy of `ajɛseɖi`'s presence, and developed a sense of jealousy. 

It took some time before they could convince `stɹai` to come with them, but it happened eventually. But now they faced the problem of going back. They sent a message to `saeθa` at `ʋeʃjœ` to rejoin them at the Forest of the Primal Weaver. But as `ajɛseɖi` and `saiʃeʈa` reached the Forest, they realized why the Followers of `seɹikani` had dispersed. The Forest had been cut down, and with that the Primal Weaver herself had passed away, her essence tied to the Forest. 

They resolved to craft a `sʋe` with the knowledge they had been given to transport them back to their `aɖasi`. This they resolved to do before `saeθa` came with `eɹaʈɛ`, `seθi`, `aʃaða` and `teʃi`. The `sʋe` was done when `saeθa` came, with a force of the *Academy* following on their heel. So they decided to implement the `sʋe` as soon as possible to escape the soldiers, but the untested `sʋe` did not perform as they expected.

Ranthis
-------

The women landed not on `aɖasi` but on another planet entirely. This planet, called Ranthis by the locals, is composed of a mono-gender race who look like `aθɶs` females but are hermaphrodites, similar to the `ajɛsɖɶ`; a typical Ranthisian has both a vagina and a penis. Besides humans, Ranthis also contains a small population of other sentient hybrid creatures who are a product of a bygone era. While there are goddesses on this world, years of war have rendered some dormant, while the few that remain active are not easily found still.

The crafted `sʋe` was cast three separate times by `ajɛseɖi`, `saeθa` and `saiʃeʈa` separately. Each of the 3 transported two others except for `ajɛseɖi` was the strongest of them and transported 2 more. `ajɛseɖi`, `aʃaða`, `θea`, `θisœʈe` and `stɹai` land in the middle of a battle and are quickly separated.

.. dropdown:: Ranthis Storyline Plans

    Upon returning to `aθɶs`, `ajɛseɖi`, `saiʃeʈa`, and `saeθa` gather everyone and escape to the forest of the Primal Weaver only to find that because of efforts by the *Academy*, the forest has been cut down, and with it the Primal Weaver has passed away. Once again, being followed by soldiers, this time coming after `saeθa`, `seθi` and `aʃaða`\ [#reason]_. With little time, the 3 women use their working knowledge of `sʋe` to attempt to transport themselves to `aɖasi`, but are unsucessful, and they get transported to Ranthis. Due to the way the spell worked (or rather did not work), the groups were split and landed in different areas of Ranthis. 

    The entire group is split thus:

    - `ajɛseɖi`, `aʃaða`, `θea`, `θisœʈe` and `stɹai` are the first group.
    - `saiʃeʈa`, `teʃi`, and `dea`, end up in a group. `θisœʈe` and `stɹai` are later separated, becoming the third group.
    - `saeθa`, `eɹaʈɛ`, and `seθi` are the last, fourth group.


    .. admonition:: Worldbuilding Plans
        :class: tip

        - Recreate the political environment in Ranthis. 
            - Keep hedonistic characterization of Sassandria.
            - Keey Minuit Oath, and `seθi`\ [#sethis-experience]_, `saeθa` and `eɹaʈɛ`'s place in it.
            - Change Agrifou and Vormi.
            - Change the political environment between these places.
        - Change plotlines for
            - `ajɛseɖi`, `aʃaða` and `θea`
            - `saiʃeʈa`, `teʃi` and `dea`
            - Figure out how `saiʃeʈa`, `teʃi` and `dea` are split off from `θisœʈe` and `stɹai`.

    For `stɹai` and `θisœʈe`, they are discovered by a traveling noble who takes them with her out of curiosity. They are given luxurious treatment in the decadent Sassandrian empire. But `stɹai`, who wishes to remain faithful to `ajɛseɖi` after discovering she is alive, is unable to immerse herself in the hedonistic customs. This soon becomes a problem, to which `θisœʈe` suggests the solution of a Ranthisian marriage with her. `stɹai` is reluctant but agrees. She slowly uses her position in the Sassandrian heirarchy to search for the rest of the group. `θisœʈe` is far less concerned with this.

    `saeθa`, `eɹaʈɛ` and `seθi` are captured by slavers who sell them to a traveling menagerie of sorts. They are put on display because of their exotic appearance. This menagerie is part of the Minuit Oath, an overarching, loosely structured organization that regulated the entertainment industry in most of Ranthis. While `saeθa` and `eɹaʈɛ` are reluctant to do so, `seθi` convinces them to play into their act. They are soon freed of the conditions that they were kept in (being treated as almost animals rather than living beings), and then slowly establish themselves higher in the organization.

    The place where `ajɛseɖi` lands is surprisingly tolerant of hers, and `aʃaða`'s and `θea`'s appearance, at least in the beginning. `ajɛseɖi` immediately inquires about the gods of the land, but is told that they have grown dorman in their state\ [#dormant-gods]_. But they are soon imprisoned as their ruler returns from a battle. A helpful character tells them about their benevolent, exiled princess who may help her, but only if she is brought back and reinstated as the queen. Thus `ajɛseɖi`, `aʃaða`, and `θea` go on a journey to find the prodigal princess and help her regain her kingdom.

    `saiʃeʈa`, `teʃi`, and `dea` come upon a village who are helpful to the foreigners, but are in trouble. They are threatened by some villains\ [#sai-villains]_. `saiʃeʈa` is recruited as one of 7 people to help defend the village, but to stand a chance they need a MacGuffin\ [#sai-macguffin]_. So `teʃi` and `dea` are sent out (maybe with a local character as well) to find this MacGuffin while `saiʃeʈa` and the rest try to survive.

    .. admonition:: Ideas for Plotlines
        :class: idea

        Some ideas for plotlines for the storylines that need to be reworked.
        
        - I think a plotline where `ajɛseɖi` uses her charisma, and political acumen to reinstate a princess or queen back to the throne would be cool. A cool addition would be that `ajɛseɖi` has to find the rightful queen and reinstate her, in exchange for a way to contact the gods of this place to return them to `aɖasi`.
        - A heist plotline is always cool
        - A group searching for a mysterious mythical creature. For what reason, who knows?
        - A storyline mirroring the *Seven Samurai*. The group needs to recruit 6 other people and defend a village from bad people.
        - A migration story, about the group helping refugees/band of people migrate to a new place.
        - Change the original `teʃi` storyline where she gets married but somehow gets into trouble and `dea` then helps her. Maybe change characters or use this for some more the damsel in distress type than `teʃi` (also, `teʃi` is too young in this instance, I think).
        - A seige where the character must hold out as long as they can. Might work well with the above point (Maybe `saiʃeʈa` and `teʃi` or just `teʃi` is stuck in a seige and `dea` must somehow help them).

    .. rubric:: Dropdown Footnote

    .. [#reason] I'm thinking something to do `seθi` escaping from her auction and the Academy wanting its instructor back. Though I'm not sure why they would be so aggressive. Think about this later.

    .. [#sethis-experience] I want to keep `seθi`'s story in the In-World Document. This could inspire `seθi`'s creature to have a modified penis as she experienced on Ranthis?

    .. [#dormant-gods] Some are still active in other states, such as Sassandria.

    .. [#sai-villains] Maybe enemy soldiers, bandits, cultists, etc. Decide during worldbuilding.

    .. [#sai-macguffin] I'm thinking a mythical creature, or an item, or an item which summons the mythical creature.

.. [#explanation] We have seen this before, slightly, but full `ʋeʃja` bring a lot of money to the *Academy*, and at the same time, there are not many women who become full `ʋeʃja`. A lot of money is put into them, and young `ʋeʃja` are also more valuable because of their virginity. Thus, `saeθa`'s plan for taking `seθi` and `aʃaða` would most definitely bring the attention of the *Academy* down on their escape.
