On Levels of Seniority in the Academy Courtesan
-----------------------------------------------

There are 4 levels of seniority that students are placed in in the *Academy Courtesan*:

.. tab-set::

    .. tab-item:: Novice
    
        These students are those that have only just entered the *Academy Courtesan*. They do not know what they are to do, and are usually composed of orphans or children of prostitutes born from the clients. These students are aged at around 18 years.
        
        **Novices** undergo 2 years of education wherein they slowly get accustomed to exposing themselves, being comfortable with their body, and finally getting comfortable with other's naked body. They are further educated in finer arts, makeup, and eloquence. During their first year, new **Novices** are given an older **Trainee** who they will live with, and offer them guidance. After their first year, they will partner with a fellow **Novice**. 
        
        This is usually done with various exercises. These exercises include lessons in musical instruments, makeup, and etiquette classes. They are also required to go through "humiliation" sessions, which are initially standing naked in front of their partner, and then teachers, stranger women, and finally stranger men. At the same time, they are encouraged to play with themselves at night before going to sleep, usually with their partners, sometimes without.
        
        During their last year as **Novice**, when they are comfortable with their bodies, they start with innocent activities with their partner. These are small things like kissing, or embracing, and finally touching each other with their hands.
        
    .. tab-item:: Trainee
    
        These students are those that have finished their 2 years as **Novices** at the *Academy Courtesan*. These students are usually aged at around 20 years.
   
        The first day, they are assigned a new room, and are given their own **Novice** to guide. Most **Trainees** have at least one **Novice**, although some may have 2. In rare cases, when there aren't new **Novices**, **Trainees** may not have any. At this stage, they undergo a year of education wherein they learn of the inside-out of sleeping with other women. Because of the highly masculine society, the primary, and final part of this training is acting the man with an artificial penis, or dildo.

        Weekly classes introduce them to foreplay techniques, female-only specific positions, and acts. The **Trainee** are encouraged to stay in touch with partners when they were a **Novice**, and to have sleep with them at least once every two days, if not once every day. 

        Furthermore, **Trainees** will also be paired with an **Accepted** with whom they will have a weekly session. This allows the **Trainee** to learn to use the dildo to "be the man" while in bed with another woman, while the **Accepted** learns to have sex with "a man". Thus both receive their respective practice. 
        
        At the end of their year, they have to take an exam. Passing this exam allows them to proceed to being an **Accepted**, while failing this exam leads to them either staying a **Trainee**, or moving onto becoming a lowly prostitute.
    
    .. tab-item:: Accepted
    
        These students are those that have finished their first 3 years into the *Academy Courtesan*. These students are usually aged at around 21 years.

        The **Accepted** spend about 2 years learning various techniques to please a man, at the same time being introduced to different arts of seducing men, and looking the part of a prostitute. Keep in mind, this part of the education still has no men participating in the actual education. This is because the *Academy Courtesan* still values the virginity of their prostitutes as they get a part of the profits that come from selling prostitutes as mistresses, or selling prostitutes' virginity.

        As mentioned before, **Accepted** are paired with a **Trainee** partner to have sex with to get accustomed to having sex with men. Besides that, they would have weekly classes with teachers who would teach them different techniques, positions and tips. Part of these classes would also involve how to lead your partner even while being the submissive partner in bed.

        During their second year, **Accepted** take fewer classes, and instead participate in either observing real prostitutes with clients, or participate with real prostitutes with their clients. As mentioned before, to keep the **Accepted**'s valuable virginity, participation is only for when the prostitute entertains female clients, and observation when the prostitute entertains male clients. This policy is strictly policed by the *Academy Courtesan*, and both the supervising prostitute and student are punished harshly if it is violated.
        
        Once the **Accepted**'s two years of education are finished, they take one more exam. Passing this exam allows them to graduate to become `ʋeʃja` (translated as the giver of love in the `aθɶs` tongue).
        
    .. tab-item:: `ʋeʃja`
    
        The last level, called the `ʋeʃja`, is a title obtained upon graduation. Named after the city where the Academy is located, `ʋeʃja` are famed prostitutes and companions which the city is known for. Following this graduation, the sacred prostitutes participate in an auction to be sent to temples, or hired as mistresses for men and women who can afford them. Those who fail to be bought in such an auction stay at the *Academy* to be used by them as they please (the *Academy* operates a brothel of their own for local patrons and middling customers).
        
        `ʋeʃja` are not given wages like normal prostitutes. For those that become mistresses, they are supported by their owner. Those who work in the *Academy* are supported by the *Academy*. While temple `ʋeʃja` are supported by the temple. Temple `ʋeʃja` are later donated back to the *Academy* to become instructors.

:zean-like:`tœeɹi`
++++++++++++++++++

For now, we will talk about the `isʋe` organization called :zean-like:`tœeɹi`. The :zean-like:`tœeɹi`, originally an organization consisting of only a few dozen members, are a loose organization representing the `isʋe` community and intent containing any harmful acts by `isʋe`. The :zean-like:`tœeɹi` are led by a circle of elders; there are either 9 elders or a number of elders equal to 5% of the total `isʋe` population. Of these elders, half of the elders are `isʋe` while the other half are `ʐisʋe` where the majority goes to the `ʐisʋe` in case of an odd number of elders. The `isʋe` elders are chose based on their abilities or their seniority, while the `ʐisʋe` elders are nominated by the different nations. How the representation of each nation in the council of elders is decided by the `isʋe` elders with the condition that each recognized nation must get at least one elder to represent them. Each `isʋe` elder and `ʐisʋe` elder work in tandem to lead a group of `isʋe` in the `ʐisʋe` elder’s nation. Of all the `ʐisʋe` elder there is one who is the oldest who knows the name of a spell that stops the spell of any other `isʋe`. By an `aiɖi` spell cast by `aʃieti` herself, the name can only be passed down to the next oldest `ʐisʋe` elder and cannot be distributed to anyone. The :zean-like:`tœeɹi` are also usually watched over by an `aiɖi`. The first one to watch over the :zean-like:`tœeɹi` was `aʃieti`. Later the `aiɖi` has changed, although those instances have been momentous and shall be noted in the future. The role of the `aiɖi` in governing the :zean-like:`tœeɹi` is minimal to non-existent. The `aiɖi` only interferes with :zean-like:`tœeɹi` business when something wrong of massive proportions has occurred. These are the rough guidelines of how the :zean-like:`tœeɹi` works as set by `ajɛseɖi`. The :zean-like:`tœeɹi` dared not do anything while `ajɛseɖi` roamed `izœ`. But the organization, while seemingly full proof against potential atrocities of `isʋe` had its flaws which we shall reveal later in the chapter.

Brainstorm of Organizations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:zean-like:`tœeɹi`:
  governing body of `isʋe`. 9 elders or 5% of `isʋe` population. Half are `isʋe`, and other half is `ʐisʋe`, with a majority of `ʐisʋe` in case of odd number;

  The :zean-like:`tœeɹi` was divided into split into multiple houses, each with their house master. These were not necessarily elders and positions were elected out of merit instead of seniority. Each house was dedicated to a single type of `sʋe`. Membership was not limited to one.

  Each major city or nation may apply for a :zean-like:`tœeɹi` chapter to be built in their capital. Each house had the choice of residing in a chapter or not. Thus, depending on the population of the house, they may be located at all chapters or only a few. Thus some chapters may have multiple houses or none.

.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#f1] The 162 years may be increased as we need more time for the cultures of `aθɶs` to expand and settle. At the current stage 1782 years is only roughly 11 generations. If we want roughly 107 generations to pass, we will need a time dilation of 1576 `aɖasi` years for 1 Ranthis year.

.. [#f2] Because this is a rather large number, we will use the term ASA, which stands for "After Second Arrival", to refer to the years after the Second Arrival, but we will continue to use the term AF, "After Founding", to refer to in the `aɖasi` History after founding.

.. [#f3] The term BF, which stands for "Before Founding", is measured in `aθɶs` years. But the term AF, which stands for "After Founding", is measured in `aɖasi` years. Both of these converge at 0 AF/BF which stands for the year when `ajɛseɖi` landed in `aɖasi`.
