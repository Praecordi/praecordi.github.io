Excerpts from Ancient History
=============================


Translator’s Note
=================

These short stories are set before the life of the Isitetho. The stories were dictated by various Avyasi, Aidi, or Teathuda and written by royal scribes. Some of these stories, I have been present at during dictation. Some are translated from older dictations. All these dictations come from various times, and in the subsequent paragraphs, I shall specifically note when each story took place and when it was dictated. Another note to human readers: these short stories has been translated from Azean to English, so keep in mind that some parts may not be the most accurate pronunciation, much less translation. Furthermore, the commentary in the short story is directed to the culture of Athos from the cultural standpoint of Azeans, which we then interpret as humans.

The first short story, *A Beginning of Change*, is set during Ayasedi’s life, specifically depicting her transition from regular school to her prostitution academy, *The Academy Courtesan*. This story is an official account, although it is not written by Ayasedi. The story was instead dictated by Ayasedi to one of her royal scribes and me on my request.

The second short story, *Relief*, is set during the beginning period of Ayasedi’s services to Othusa. Dictated by Saetha, this story depicts the introduction of Ayasedi and their life under the mistress Othusa, giving us a glimpse of characters that have been seldom mentioned: Othusa, and the famed Dhoda, mother of the Isitetho.

The third short story, *Escape*, is set during before the death of Othusa. Dictated by Saisheta, this story describes the circumstances of Ayasedi, Saetha, Saisheta, Dhoda, and Strai’s escape after the invasion of Othusa, while also giving a glimpse of what the relationship between Ayasedi and Saisheta was like. We also get a first look at a teenage Thisote and her personality. The story was dictated after the first human contact was made.

The fourth short story, *Lust*, is set during a time in Ranthis. This story is the only story not dictated by a person who was present during the story, but rather gleaned from Ayasedi, and Saisheta. The story, compiled from diaries and journals hidden in the Isitetho’s libraries, describes a part of the life of Strai and Thisote in Ranthis detailing the occasion of Thisote’s and Strai’s marriage. The result of this story, in a roundabout way, leads to the birth of Ide, and thus in an important milestone of Adasi history, even though it is not situated in Adasi.

The fifth short story, *Discovery*, is set during a time in Ranthis. Dictated by Sethi, this story describes some of her hardships during her time in Ranthis. It especially describes how her relationship between her, and her mother changed, and how her relationship between her and Saetha grew. We see how Sethi went from the teenager we knew little about to the enthralling Zoedashi she is now.

Most of these stories, unless noted otherwise, were dictated after the first human contact was made, a long time after the events of this story have transpired. Thus, some conversations and descriptions that you read are interpretations, and might not be letter to letter the words of the Isitetho *during that period*.

The Beginning of Change
=======================

In those days, my life was full of ignorance: ignorance of our present circumstances, ignorance of my mom’s profession, and ignorance of my future. My days started with food, study, play, food again, and then sleep. And then repeat. It seemed ideal, and in some ways, it seems ideal now. There were no problems to face, no dreams to complete, and no one to live for. I didn’t think, *what was next?* I just did what I felt like doing. I didn’t realize the state of my mother, which was soon to be mine, though I loved her like any child would her mother. The thought never occurred to me, and the primary reason for that was how my mother shielded me.

We lived away from the brothel. She would leave every day in a traditional *yarti*\  [1]_\ *,* a long dress tied around the back with a short jacket worn on top. What I did not notice was the larger neckline, shorter dress, and the overall revealing nature of the *yarti*. It did not occur to me why mother sometimes arrived disheveled or walked oddly. Although for one of 15 winters, I could never have guessed my mother’s profession, I still reflect on why I did not think it odd. Truthfully, I did not care enough to.

We lived in a community, shared by many families of various artisans. Most of the men, the head in the household [2]_, would be the ones who would go out to work. There were some women, the head’s mates, who would go, so I never thought it strange that my mother would also work.

I remember a day when my 16\ :sup:`th` winter approached its end, my mother cryptically told me of what she did.

“Ayasedi! Come here, my love,” Dhoda, my mother cried.

The tired me arrived from playing with friends went over and sat on my mother’s lap. “Yes, mother.”

“How was your day today? What did my sweet daughter do?”

“We enacted the victory of warrior Deva! Arivi brought this broken breastplate, and dull sword from his father’s workshop, and I played Deva! It was so fun! Though one of the mothers did scold me for beating the boys. It wasn’t my fault, but she wouldn’t listen.”

“Why did you hurt the boys?”

“It was the time when Deva was captured! They tortured her, remember. Well, Arivi got from somewhere that Deva was stripped and then beat. They insisted I take off my top, if not be naked. So, I punched him, and any other who supported him. I don’t know how the other girls didn’t say anything!”

Don’t be surprised. In Athos, breasts were considered protected. We found it disrespectful to show breasts to anyone after they came out. Once breasts came out, they could only be seen by their owner and her mother. Even her siblings and father, much less others, would not be allowed to glimpse, much less touch, breasts. Very well, let me continue.

“Good! You did the right thing.” Mother looked a bit proud, but there was a hint of sadness. Even young me could see it.

“What is it, mother?” I asked. She pushed me up.

Walking over to the room, she started undressing me. “You have become dirty. Let us clean you before sleeping.” Her fingers were slow, yet dexterous. She let my clothes fall, leaving me unclothed in the cold room. I remember my eyes darting over the open window in worry. But then I shook it off, reasoning that no one would be outside in the dark. Nonetheless, my fingers twitched to close the window curtains. Mother stepped back, looking at my whole body, lost in her thoughts. And then just as suddenly, she snapped, and started moving towards a bucket full of water. “Ayasedi. What do people say about you?”

“Mother? … The boys think I am pretty. The girls, they like me too. We all like each other and play well together.”

“And the adults?”

“Uhm… I heard some of the mothers talking about me. Some mothers look at me when they think I’m not looking. They smile and talk nice of me amongst themselves. Some don’t like me as much. Come to think of it, those mothers that don’t like me are the mothers of the girls. They always try to get them to stay away from me.”

“And what about the men?”

“Mother, why are you asking this? When the men come from work, they always look at the way of us children and smile.”

“Do any look at you and smile?”

“No, mother,” I said, but mother put her hand on my stomach. She had caught me. “Yes, mother. Some of them do. I see some look at me for a long time, but look away, when they think I saw them. Why are you asking me this?”

She pushed my hand away when I started to help her rub the water on me. “Let me clean my child. It has been too long.” She seemed to me to be acting strangely.

“It is because I am older now.”

“Yes, you are.” Her hands went to my breast, cupping them. A shudder ran through me, as her hands spread their warm through my breast. “Tell me. What do they say of your body?”

“Mother. The window is open.”

“Yes, it is. Tell me, Ayasedi.”

“They say I have inherited your beauty. They say that I may be even more beautiful than you when I grow up. I think they lie.”

She moved her hands down to my back, slowly rubbing out the mud and stains. “And what do they say of your body?”

“They say nothing, mother. Other than, I will do well with my body. I might become finer than my mother. I will be important. What do they mean, mother?”

“You know. Once this winter ends, you will be sent somewhere else to learn. You will learn to do what I do.”

“What do you do, mother?”

“I help people. When they don’t have this one thing, or have little of it, they come to me, and I give it to them. One day, you will learn what I do, and to do what I do. When you do remember that whatever others say you are, if you are good at what you do, you will become especially important, and you will lead a good life.”

“I don’t underst–” That’s when my mother’s finger ran over the line in my crotch, slowly going into it. It felt warm and strange, and a massive shudder ran through me, one that even mother felt. She pulled back her hands, seeming ashamed and quickly ran out of the room, closing the window curtains.

That was the beginning of the change.

--------------

After that day, my mother did not attempt to explain to me anything. She did savor all the moments that we spent together. Of course, at that time I did not see those changes, nor did I care for what happened that day. And then one day, at school, they called for my name. I knew that the end of the winter, and they would take me where I would learn my mother’s trade. No one knew which day that would be. I was surprised.

There were other girls with me: 21, including me. None of them were from the same region as I was. We flew a little way, and then we walked the rest to a large, metal building. The architecture was flowing. The first I saw of the building was 2 wings, extremely tall at the end and situated in a V-shape. Near the spot of the meeting of the two buildings was a small waterfall and beautiful garden around it. The tops of the building themselves were situated in an eccentric curve. The wings combined into one large hall, which was flat and wide rather than tall, yet with similar eccentric curve to the roof. This hall ended abruptly at one end to 2 massive glass domes situated side by side with a fountain of water at both tops.

Us girls were led into the right wing and into a chamber lined with wood. Attached to the room on the right of where we entered were 4 doors. And arrayed throughout the room were beds instead of chairs. These beds were again wooden, but with no mattresses and only a sheet. The room was shaped like an amphitheater, similar to those that mother took me to. A man and a woman entered the lower section of the room [3]_.

As the other girls lined up the woman spoke, “Welcome. I trust you know why you are here, but not necessarily where. My name is Rita [4]_.” She slowly examined the other girls. Some of us were afraid, while most of us stood with curiosity and confusion. “Some of you have inherited this profession, while others have come upon it. But I would like to assure you, that unlike this society, I realize that you have come by this without a choice of your own.” She paused again, letting the words sink in. “But do realize that while I am sympathetic of your position, I will not be easy on you. What I will be is I will be fair.” She paused again, this time for a shorter period of time. “Now for the first order of things: which of you know what this institute will teach you to do?”

Some girls raised their hands.

“Good. Now I would like you to each take a seat.” The girls started to shuffle to a bed of their choice. Slightly timid for the first time, I ended with a bed in the second row, but there was no one in the bed before me. The man had yet to speak a word. “It is difficult to explain why you are here. Thus, instead I will start with your very first lesson instead. You will remove all of your clothes and get seated on your beds.” A look of confusion and fear passed through all the girls. No one moved.

The woman smiled and then started to strip. A collective gasp escaped from all the girls. “Some of you knew what was going to happen, perhaps your mother told you. Some of you are confused by this request and are probably thinking why I am asking you to do this. Well, for those of you that are orphans, this was your destiny. For those whose mothers have not yet told you, you have inherited the profession of prostitutes, providing enjoyment and happiness to others through your body.” As she was saying this she was fully stripped, standing stark naked in front of all the girls as well as the man. She walked to the man and raised his hand to lie on her breast, while the other hand went to her crotch. There was a louder gasp in the room.

The woman kissed the man, while he started to knead her breast and stroke her crotch. Many of the girls looked away, while some, including me, watched in fear. The performance ended after a minute with a sigh from the woman. Then she looked at us and smiled.

“This is not what we shall do today. This was merely a glimpse of what is ahead. For now, please take off your clothing.” She scanned the room with her eyes. The room was silent with no movement. She walked forward to me. I remembered thinking *why did it have to be me?* Smiling, she said, “Here, let me help you.”

Her firm hands untangled my crossed and trembling hands and took off my *yarti* top. My hands moved to resist, but then I looked into her eyes, and as if moving by their own accord, my arms moved down to their side. My whole body started feeling cold and shivered uncontrollably. I felt all the eyes in the room on me.

The woman’s hands were slow in pulling the top. It seemed that she intentionally brushed my breast, and my neck making me shudder as she pulled the strings off my top. The top now removed, she folded it and placed it under the bed. Then she moved to my back, moving her hands across my arm softly. She softly undid the strings of the bottom dress, first from the neck and then from the waist. And finally, she slipped the dress off my arms and let it fall down.

I shivered, my arms instinctively moving towards my breasts and crotch to cover them, but the woman, Rita, pulled them down, and glared at me, shaking her head. “What is your name?”

I shivered from the sudden cold. “A- A- Ayasedi.”

“Well, Ayasedi. You might have the most beautiful body I have seen in any of my new recruits, maybe even any of the other women here.” She said this while caressing my breasts, slowly sliding down her hand over my arms and stomach. “Now much as Ayasedi has done, why don’t you all take off your clothing. I have been lenient towards you so far, but I shall not hesitate to act if you refuse.” At this the man finally smiled, a toothy grin.

The sound of slow shuffling enveloped the room. Soon, the room was filled with girls sitting atop their beds, naked, some trying to cover themselves. I? I was too cold and shocked to do anything. Rita moved around the room, nodding, occasionally removing the hand from the chest, sometimes caressing some breast. Once she had observed all 21 girls, she arrived in the front, still completely naked. “Congratulations! You have all successfully completed your first lesson. Our next order of things will be introducing you to your peer mentor. These girls, who have advanced further in the training process, will be there to answer questions and guide you through you first day and maybe even the rest of your training. Think of them as your Academy given friend. They will be waiting for you outside this room. Each door to your right contains some names on them. If your name is on that door, that is where you shall exit from. Next, from now on, you will be living here. I believe this does not make much difference to those that lived in the orphanage. For the rest, rest assured that you will get the chance to head back to get your things, and occasionally go back to live with your mother. With this, I welcome you again to the Academy Courtesan.”

The girls sat absolutely still, until both the man and Rita had left the room. The speed and alacrity with which each girl wore their *yarti* was… indescribable. Slowly, the girls shuffled towards the door to check their names. There did not seem to be any order to the names. I found mine in the 3\ :sup:`rd` door and went through. Of the 5 older girls standing, one called out my name. I followed the sound, heading towards the older girl. She was a slim girl, dressed in an odd *yarti*. Her bottom did not cover her chest, but instead hung on to her waist [5]_, while her top was a normal *yarti* top except the left shoulder sloped down, revealing more skin and an immodest cleavage. Besides that, the girl was pretty, almost cute with white hair and a wide smile that made holes on her cheek.

“You are Ayasedi? My name is Erata [6]_. I will be your peer mentor.” Her smile widened. I managed to reply with a weak smile of my own. “Shy, are you? I was like that when I came first too. Well, we can talk later. I will have to stay with you for the first few months of your training. First, I will have to accompany you to your home to get your stuff. Your mother has been informed and your clothing should be packed.”

I remember the trip went in silence as I thought about what was going to happen. I still did not know what it was that I was going to do. Obviously, this Academy was not to teach young girls to be able to stand in front of a man naked. There was more, yet my young mind did not know where to start. On top of that, I did not know how to confront my mother.

When the confrontation did come, no words came out of my mouth, and neither from my mother’s. Her eyes were filled with sorrow, and guilt.

“I will see you again, my love. You will not be going far. I hope you can forgive, but understand that I had no choice, just as you do not right now.” She paused, looking at me as if she would soak in these moments as much as she could before they escaped. “And remember what I have said. This does not have to be bad. Look to the future positively.”

She turned to Erata. “Please go easy on her. She is still young.” Erata bowed at her words. She was looking at mother, strangely. Almost reverently.

And that was all that was said. We returned.

--------------

The room that I was given, was not really my room.

“Here is where you will be living,” Erata said as she slid the door open. The room was a small thing, with a similar small wooden bed as was in the room before except this time with a mattress, on our left as we entered. A window on the left wall overlooked a pretty garden. On our right, there was a closet and in front of us was a large open space. There was no desk, as any student should have. A flute was hung placed on wooden pegs on the wall in front of us, and underneath were two additional pegs. On the right wall was a door that presumable led to a bathroom. And on the opposite wall, many squares were built into the walls, for a purpose which was unknown to me. Yet the most surprising aspect of the room were multiple renditions of my mother, yet in less clothing on her. “Oh, please excuse me.” She rushed over to the wall, hastily but carefully peeling the renditions off her wall.

“This is bigger than I imagined for a newcomer such as me.” I commented meekly.

“You said something. Good! Well, this is not just for you. Well, it’s actually not yours. It’s mine. I just said it’s where you will be living. Novices are supposed to live with older Trainees.” She jumped on her bed. “Come sit with me. Let’s talk.”

I sighed, resigned to my fate. I shuffled over to the bed and sat on it, keeping a fair amount of distance between myself and Erata. “Do we have to go a fetch a bed for myself from somewhere, or do I sleep on the floor?”

“What? No! You’re supposed to sleep with me on this bed. It’s small, I know. But the Matron, Rita, checks late in the night, and early in the morning whether the new novices are sleeping on the bed with us or not, especially in the early days.” She must have seen the surprise on my face. “I know it’s terrible. This all probably seems like new. But you’ll get used to it slowly. The good news is you don’t have class for a few days, so you acclimate to the unique environment.” She paused, waiting for me to say something. “You’re still in shock. If you have any questions, I can answer them for you.” She paused again, longer, looking at me expectantly.

“I don’t. I feel tired. I want to sleep. Can I sleep?”

She seemed slightly surprised. “Uhm… sure. I’ll let you sleep on your own right now. I will have to sleep next to you at night.” She got up. “I am going out. While you are allowed to go out, I would suggest you don’t, if you don’t want to be more shocked.” With that, she left.

When I next woke up, Erata was in the room, sitting on the floor on her knees, her eyes closed. Her hands rested on her knees and occasionally twitched. She was not wearing a *yarti*, even the previous kind. It was a thick band right across her breast that was tied in the front showing even more of her cleavage, and a *yarti* bottom, but shorter. The window indicated that it was getting darker outside, and window offered a clear look at the red sky and setting sun. I was surprised how Erata was wearing such clothing, even while the window was open, and people still walked outside. I shuffled uneasily, which prompted Erata to open her eyes.

“You’re awake! Did you sleep well?” She still sat on her knees.

“Yes. Thank you. I feel much better.” Erata nodded. When she tried to get up, it was as if her knees failed her, and she landed on her hands with a cry of pain. Her entire body started to twitch, and even her hands gave out. I got up, but she signaled me away. The twitching subsided, and she sighed in relief. She got up and brushed her bottom.

“I will be back,” she said with which she rushed into the bathroom. A few minutes later, she came out holding something. She walked over to the cabinet and put it in.

“Are you okay?” I asked, concerned.

“What? Yes! Of course! That was fun!” She must have seen my confusion because she immediately replied, “Oh, you’ll understand later.”

“So, would this be a suitable time to ask you questions?”

“Yes, of course. I will try to answer as many as I can. But we should get ready for sleep before I will. Matron likes us ready before sunset.”

“Ready?”

“Oh, yes! Stupid me. It is our instruction for the first few weeks to make the Novices sleep without clothing. Actually, I should have told you this before, but Matron wasn’t going to check on you then. It’s to get you acclimated to the new atmosphere that this academy has.” I blushed at the thought.

“And I am going to have to sleep with you naked?” She nodded. “And are you… going to be… naked?”

“Well, actually that’s how I always sleep,” she shrugged, as if obvious. She saw my blush, and thus said, “I know you don’t feel comfortable with it, but these are the rules. But good news is, I am a girl too, right?”

“I suppose so.”

“Well, if you feel comfortable, I’ll go first.” She started to undo the knot on the band on her breast, and then undid the button on her *yarti* bottom, letting it fall to the ground. Folding both of them, she placed them under the bed and gestured me to get up.

“Erata, can we close the window at least?”

“For today. But trust me, soon enough it will not make a difference.” She walked over and closed the window and the curtains.

I got up and started to undo the buttons on my top and untied the strings underneath. It felt strange to strip in front of someone other than my mother. I quick glance as Erata showed she was silently giggling with anticipation. I then undid the buttons on the skirt and then reached towards the back to undo the strings. Erata quickly jumped, “Here let me help.” She walked over to my back and quickly pulled the strings untying them.

She came forward and stared at me for a good minute, after which the only words that escaped her were, “You have a most beautiful body. I don’t know what I was expecting.”

“What do you mean?” I asked, covering my breast and crotch as best I can. She gestured for me to lay in bed. I moved in towards the wall, while she sat on the outer side.

“Well, let’s start from the very beginning. You’re probably curious what we do. What your mother did?” Her hand started to caress my hand. I didn’t stop her. It felt strangely good.

“Yes. Yes, I am.”

“Well, let me ask you a question. Have you ever seen a boy, or a man?” She inched closer, and her hand went from my arm to my stomach. I squirmed, but I had nowhere to go, and yet again, it felt good to feel another’s skin.

“What kind of question is that? Of course. There were many in my neighborhood.”

“Well, yes. I meant have you seen a man naked?”

I blushed. “No.”

“Well, they are made slightly different than us woman.”

“Of course. They have shorter hair, and they don’t have breasts like we do.”

“Yes, but they also don’t have this.” Her hand moved to my crotch. I trembled at the touch and immediately swept her hand before she could do much.

“What do you mean?”

“Well, woman, we have this whole in our body in our crotch. See.” She placed her hand on her own crotch this time and pushed a finger in. I looked away.

“Ayasedi. Don’t be shy. I’m trying to help you. Just look.” I peeked, and then slowly fully turned. “Good. So, men, they don’t have this hole.”

“So, where do they pee from?” She laughed.

“Well, they have something else. Let me show you.” She walked over to the cabinet and took something out, and placed it near her crotch, doing something. When she turned, a curved cylinder protruded from her hole at an almost 90 degrees. It bulged near the end and was filled with veins. And it was red. “This is what boys have. It is called a penis. It has a hole at the very end, over here, from where they pee.” She pointed at the end of the bulge.

“And it’s red?”

“No, no. This is just a tool for women. See.” She pulled the cylinder out from her hole. The cylindrical part that was submerged itself was long and at an angle with the bulged cylinder. The submerged end itself seemed somewhat large. She passed it to me. “It’s usually the same color as their skin.”

I hesitantly took it. It was a strange smooth texture. I quickly gave it back to her, and she put it back in the cabinet and then sat on the bed besides me, closer this time. “It doesn’t hurt?”

“Huh? What?”

“Putting that thing inside of you?”

“Oh, the tool? No.”

“So why are you telling me this?”

She took one of her hands and rubbed my hair gently, while the other rested on my stomach. “This difference between the men and women created our job in the beginning. Now, men, they have this white fluid inside of them. When they put this fluid inside women, the women can get pregnant and give birth to a baby. Well, this white fluid comes from this penis. So how do they get this inside a woman’s body? Well, they have to put this penis inside her hole, and then they pump out the white fluid inside her and thus she can give birth to a child.”

“And the woman can’t drink this fluid, because it’s too far from the place they give birth from?”

“Ummm, yes. Exactly.” She stopped the gently rubbing and got closer. I remember the sensation of her breasts touching my arm. That was the first time I had touched another’s breasts. Suddenly, the door behind us opened to reveal Rita, fully clothed this time.

She seemed pleased. “You two are getting well.”

Erata bowed slightly with her head. “Yes, matron. I was just answering some questions for Ayasedi. We will be going to sleep soon.”

“Good. Very well, continue.” The matron left, leaving us along again.

“Okay. So, let’s continue. Now, Those That Made Us, they knew that if women did not birth enough babies, our race would die. So, they made us such that this action of putting the penis in our hole felt good to men and women, so that we would keep doing it again.”

“That makes sense.”

“But after a while, it felt good to just put this penis inside a women’s hole, so they started doing this more often without giving birth to a child.”

“So why don’t I see more people doing this?” She laughed. Her hand again slowly moved down to my crotch, caressing the folds of my skin near the whole. She came closer, my arms fully between her breasts. It felt good.

“Well, because some men are possessive. They said, I want this woman, she is called my wife, and only I can use her for pleasure, no other men can. And soon enough, every man had a wife. This act of putting the penis in a woman’s hole became thought of as a private affair. To discourage other men from claiming their woman, they told her to go out clothed. To not reveal their breasts or their holes to others such that they are not tempted.

“But then men got greedy. When their wife got pregnant, they did not have anyone to give them pleasure. So, they went to other women. These women don’t give birth, and their only job is to give men pleasure and happiness.”

“Well, this seems selfish for men. They can go to other women for pleasure, but women can’t go to other men.” My whole body trembled slightly with her touch.

“Yes. Yes, it is. But men are stronger, and they threatened women to not go to other men. And thus, this rule came to be.

“Now these other women, they felt unfair. They said, we give men this pleasure, but we get nothing. No man will marry us, and if no man will marry us, how will we get food? So, they asked for money. And only in exchange for money did the women give pleasure.” Her fingers started to make circles near my crotch. Her movements carried over to her breasts, which rubbed against my arms. I started to twitch slightly.

“This institution was the result. Some things have changed. For example, there is no requirement that we cannot give birth. If by accident some men do give us their fluid, there is a chance we may give birth, and that is okay. And the other thing that changed is that we not only give pleasure to men, but also other women. Wives that have only one man. Those that are dissatisfied. If a woman comes for pleasure, we cannot deny them.”

“How does that work? Giving women pleasure? There are no men like us?”

“No, there aren’t.” She smiled. It was an almost devious smile. Her movements became more rapid, and suddenly, her lips touched the nape of my neck. A series of spasms ran through the muscles of my body. My hands instinctively went to my crotch forcing Erata’s hand to push against my crotch. The spasms forced my hips to rise, and it was as if a new force grabbed me. And finally, it subsided, leaving me panting heavily. “But you’ll learn.” She smiled.

A strange compulsion hit me, and I turned and hugged her, breasts touching. A strange warm feeling filled me. I never knew when I fell asleep.

Relief
======

Today was the day of a battle. Othusa would not want me to be late. She did not like me missing her getting ready for battle. Unlike the warriors in father’s retinue, Othusa was much more extravagant in her martial display, especially during battle. The noble warriors that died for us were much humbler. They fought during battle, and indulged in extravagancies after their victories, dressing in the much-known fanciful dresses of Yuvi [7]_, and drinking and eating. Othusa, she indulged in the best and worst of life constantly.

As I entered the tent where she was readying, she was doing what I expected of her, drinking. I ignored her state. No longer was I a royal, but instead a maiden to this creature. Three years in service to her, and I had barely gotten used to thinking as a servant and not as royal. The woman a large muscular being, wide shouldered, and lean bodied, swayed as the many surrounding servants carefully pulled at the pieces of clothing from her body. The clear faced woman did not seem like the genius, battle-hardened warrior most would imagine her to be. The golden-haired maiden was young; no scars covered her face, and the glint in her eyes could almost convince you there was innocence behind those eyes.

She saw me standing near the entrance and said something softly. The servants surrounding her stood upright and filed out immediately, without question leaving the woman half un-clothed standing in the center of the room still holding the tankard of liquid.

“Come! Get me ready!” she said, spreading her hands out in invitation. I bow down all the way, and hurry towards Othusa, straightening only when reaching her [8]_. I quietly slipped off the thick cloth and placed it on the empty stand to the side. Sitting down in front of her, I moved to undo the strings of the skirt, fumbling at the knot. I felt her stare on me.

Serving her had been difficult. Although her treatment had not been entirely worthy of a princess, even a captured one, I had not been as badly treated as some servants. My quarters were better, so was my food. I sat and ate with Othusa at her table, and she was pleasant enough in the beginning, and surprisingly understanding of the pain I was going through; the pain she had brought upon me. My duties were simple enough: bathe her, select her dress, and then dress her, do her hair, and maintain her overall appearances. I was called upon at most twice or three times a day. More at times of battle or war. At all other times, I was free to do what I pleased. Of course, good things are never there to stay. Something had changed.

The skirt slipped off as the knots undid, and in front of me stood the smooth vagina of the mistress. One that zoomed towards my face in a matter of seconds. A strong heavy hand painfully pushed against the back of my head burying my face inside her crotch. I let out a muffled scream, which seemed to cause Othusa even more pleasure, as she let out moan. Her hands started to rub my head painfully over her crotch. A motion more consistent with how one would use a sponge to wash one’s body. Instead, this was using my screaming self to pleasure her. I struggled out but with negligible effect against the much more powerful woman. As quick as that happened, she let me go. I fell backwards from my struggle, gasping for air, the thick scent still in my nose and mouth, almost like an after taste.

Othusa laughed! “Not now, woman! Dress me, and after I shall show you what I am capable of!” She laughed hysterically as she once again stood in a T-pose ready to be dressed. My chest heaved as I tried to breathe out the taste and scent of the woman. “Come on, woman! Every second you delay does not bode well for you!”

I hurried up and quickly dressed Othusa, first in new clothing and armor. The rest of the process went by without a similar altercation. The effects had faded, yet the thought of the future was still troubling.

--------------

I lay in the cot in my tent. It wasn’t my tent, but Othusa’s. As her maiden, I was given no other place and slept in her tent on a small cot beside her grand bed. Normally, this would not be the place to relax, but with Othusa fighting the battle, this place was one ensured to have ultimate privacy.

What had changed was me. Three years ago, when Othusa conquered Yuvi and killed all the warriors and my parents, I was still young. Yes, I could understand and was old enough to make a servant, but I was young. The flat-chested, wide-eyed child was protected by the Athos decency and culture. It had not been a month, and the hints of development had sprouted. And thus, no longer was I protected. At first, it had been only small touches and frisks. Then, there had been requests of dancing and entertainment that slowly got more vulgar. Soon after came orders of sleeping in her bed, sometimes clothed, sometimes un-clothed. Events like the most recent one, had been slow to come, but were now becoming frequent. Hours passed as I lay in bed envisioning my fate.

Soon enough I heard a voice, “Princess Yuvi.” There were some who still recognized me and gave me respect, if not for my actions, but for the actions of my family past. It was not easy to forget the prestige and grandeur of the great Yuvi family. The now non-existent Yuvi family. “Princess, the battle has finished. She will be arriving soon.” Bless her. There were some who had helped her in her transition, and some who still do whatever they could for the princess-captive.

I trudged towards the center tent where Othusa headed after battle to make her announcements. The massive tent was colored in the colors of Othusa, a dulled bronze and green. The soldiers and followers of the army alike moved towards the center. The soldiers were exhausted and not many talked. That was an indication for the worst. I moved to the side of the tent, away from the public entrance.

A small flap on the side was protected by two massive men, armored in dulled bronze and purple instead of the green. They carried a massive halberd that was even taller than their carriers. They nodded towards me as I got closer, easing their halberds aside to clear the way.

I stopped before entering. “How did it go? It doesn’t look too good from the looks of it?”

“Do not worry, Princess. She won. But it was close. Her mood might be off owing to her injury. First in much time,” one guard said, nodding at her. I nodded back in thanks and entered the tent.

The massive tent was already crowded. From the raised podium where I entered, the sea of people extended all the way back, waiting to hear the outcome of the battle. Othusa had not yet entered, but many of her generals in bloodied armor stood on the great platform discussing something amongst themselves. I stood by some other servants, waiting.

Othusa did not enter with her usual flourish. The strong woman that had assaulted me this morning looked tired now. Her hands grasped her side, but she did not slouch. Nor did pain seem evident on her face. As much as I hated the woman, I could not help but admire the poise, strength, and dignity she carried herself with. After much effort, I pushed down that sudden feeling of respect for the woman.

The bronze and purple armored figure was not the only person to enter the room. At her side was a tall, impressive figure. A slim woman with dark hair and intense eyes walked next to Othusa, with a steady luscious gait that bespoke another kind of grace. She wore a familiar green and white *yarti* of a strange cut. Unlike normal loose flowing *yarti*, this one hugged the woman as if in love with her, showing her impressive figure. The woman calmly strode beside Othusa, with no expression on her face.

A cheering rose as Othusa entered. She silenced the crowd with a hand.

“We have won the battle! The city of Veshyo [9]_ is ours!” she announced in a strong voice that echoed through the whole tent. A massive cheer burst from the crowd. “All of you have struggled for us, for me. But the struggle has not gone to waste. The gold mine that is Veshyo is finally ours. Not only I, but all of us, shall reap the benefits to this victory. And with that, my friends, I want to congratulate you! After this victory, I want to fulfill your wishes. The biggest wish you have. For 3 days, the city is yours to do as you wish!” She fell silent as the words sank in, and the cheers continued. The woman frowned at those words, but as quickly, her face changed back to being expressionless.

“And in 3 days, we will all leave for home. But let me warn you, my men! Do not revel too much! Maybe, by the end of these 3 days, you’ll be too drunk and sore to even get up to go home!

“Rejoice, my friends! Farewell for now! We shall meet again in 3 days!”

With that she stepped away from the edge and walked towards us, entourage of generals and the woman in tow.

“Get me a medic and bath!” she said with a slight growl. “Not you, Saetha,” she said as I turned. “I want you to go get Ayasedi a tent for now. Help her with moving in. Oh, and take some soldiers to the city, and pick up her stuff and her mother.”

“Ok, mistress,” I bowed. She grunted and walked away with the medic that arrived.

The woman, Ayasedi, turned towards me with an unexpected smile on her face. “Hello. My name is Ayasedi.”

“Saetha Yuvi.” I replied, unable to meet her strange enthusiasm. I started walking in the direction of one of the tents. Othusa hadn’t specified who to take. There were some soldiers who claimed they were distant Yuvi descendants who I felt comfortable with. Their company tent wasn’t far.

“You’re the Captured Princess, aren’t you?”

“Yes. You say that like it’s a good thing.”

“No, no. That’s not what I meant. We always talk about you. We felt bad for what happened to you.”

“And yet you’re with her.” That seemed to have silenced her. We walked like that for a while. We reached the tents, where some men were sitting outside having a snack and talking.

“Is Vrisa [10]_ here?” I asked one of them.

“Inside,” he grunted without a glance.

“Can you get him for me?”

He grunted again but got up. A while later, the man came with Vrisa. The dark man had managed to take off only his chest armor.

“What do you need, Princess?” He didn’t bow. Though at this point, even the Princess wasn’t necessary.

“I want an *artshi*\  [11]_ and some soldiers to get to the city. On Othusa’s orders.”

“Ahhh, the men are tired. Is this something that needs to happen right now.”

“It would be convenient if it happened as soon as possible. There is someone waiting for me,” Ayasedi said for the first time. Vrisa even seemed surprised she was there.

“Well, the men won’t like this.”

“We won’t be much trouble, I promise. It’ll be a quick in and out. Get some luggage and pick up a passenger and you’ll be back before you know it.” Suddenly, the woman’s expressions changed. It was something indescribable. Not amazing. Completely ordinary, and unnoticeable. But something changed, something that just couldn’t be described. Vrisa looked at the woman, and then nodded.

Her expressions returned back to normal in an instant.

--------------

I spent the trip in silence. The woman, Ayasedi, she talked with the men, seemed to get along with them. They laughed and played, completely comfortable with her. Her posture was poised, but still relaxed. Her arms were by her side, placed carefully on her knee, and even while giggling, her eyes seemed alert at everything that was happening around her.

Her behavior got me even more curious as to who she was. And somehow, she seemed to notice that. Or at least I though she noticed it because she excused herself and walked over to the end of the ship where I sat.

“I feel like we got off on the wrong note,” she said as she sat beside me. Even though both of us were covered, I felt exposed to her slight touch. “I have a feeling that we are going to be seeing each other a lot. And getting off this badly will not be good for either of us.

“So, what do you say to starting again?”

There seemed to be something genuine in her, although the curiosity and doubt still lingered, making me suspicious of her offer.

“I’m sorry. It is me. I have had a dreadful day. I just need the day to be done. What do you say to starting again, tomorrow?”

She smiled a little. “As long as it happens.”

The woman seemed to emit a strange aura around her, willing people to act the way she wanted. It was a neat trick. One she had been trained for as a princess. That skill and practice had faded. But this woman was a master. But there was no way this woman was of noble birth. She could not be of royal house of Veshyo. Even if she was captured, she should not have been in such a fine mood. I’m thinking too much. Whoever she is, I can worry about it later. We had arrived.

We landed in an open space inside a community. The houses were small and shabby, but neatly packed. The woman walked around like it was home. But the fine clothing she wore seemed to contrast that. We walked to a small 2 room house at the edge of the community. She instructed some of the soldiers to help her with some luggage. After the luggage had been moved to the ship, an older woman about as tall as Ayasedi, and looking almost the same, stepped out of the house. She looked around with a melancholic expression, a tear almost dropping from her eyes. And then moved towards the ship. Ayasedi walked beside her, hands on shoulders, comforting her. A thing to be noted was the way the two walked. Ayasedi’s mother, as any could have guessed, exhibited a behavior quite like Ayasedi’s, poised and graceful. Though strangely, the older woman’s actions seemed much more practiced than Ayasedi’s.

A few people had gathered around, most in a quiet huddle against the contingent of conquering soldiers, staying at a safe distance. The reaction of these two women leaving their community was mixed. Some were sighing of relief, while others seemed somewhat saddened.

The men worked quickly, and there wasn’t much luggage. In a matter of minutes, the little luggage that the two women was moved. As we prepared to load the *artshi*, another woman arrived, one with an uncommon white hair. She moved with the same grace as Ayasedi. The woman walked over to Ayasedi, where they had a tearful conversation, which ended in a long stretched out hug. We left soon after.

In the *artshi*, the older woman, Ayasedi’s mother, came to me and asked, “please, may I sit next to you?”

“Of course. You may.” I said indicating to sit.

She was silent at first, but then spoke, “Please excuse my daughter. She does not realize when she helps someone or harms. I can see that you do not welcome her overwhelmingly optimistic nature. It is not for everyone.”

“It isn’t her fault that my life is such.”

“Yes. I realize. You seem like a nice and beautiful girl. Your life has so much potential. Why then are you so gloomy?”

“My days of happiness are past, *yuri*\  [12]_. I may have used all my luck and good life to early, and now I am left with none.”

“Oh, don’t say that. Whatever may have happened, you have your whole life ahead of you to change that. This world is not split in good life and bad. It is only life. The good and bad is what you decide to make of it. What has happened to you, it is not luck, but fate. And fate decides what will happen. You will decide if what happened is good. Look at me. Fate gave me no son, so I live with my daughter. I may live the rest of my life in solitude, not troubling my daughter, or I may have to endure more so that my daughter may have a better life. But as much as I can do, I still cannot change my daughter’s fate. She will become who she will become no matter what. I can see that Fate has much more in store for you.

As for my daughter, the only reason she is so optimistic is because, while you have listened to these words only once, Ayasedi has grown up listening to them. Her way of fighting her Fate is to taunt it. Fate does not control the way she looks at her life, thus she always looks forward positively.”

“Thank you. I cannot say I understand, but it makes sense.”

The older woman laughed. “It is not for everyone. Maybe it is for you, maybe not. But at least it will help you understand my daughter better.”

I smiled. I didn’t know why but looking at the mirth of the older woman just made me. Why did she laugh? Who knows! But the joy in the woman was contagious.

“My name is Dhoda. What name has Fate ordained you?”

We set up a tent for Ayasedi and her mother, not too far from Othusa’s.

“Thank you, Princess,” Ayasedi said as the final preparations of the tent were finished. “I would love to have you over tomorrow once you are done with your duties. Mother loved to talk with you. She hasn’t enjoyed such a friendly conversation in a while.”

“I would love to, Ayasedi,” I replied and left feeling slightly better.

I left taking the longest way back to Othusa’s tent, dreading the moment that I would have to return to her again. Even smaller excursions like these were pleasant changes to staying around that woman all the time. The longer route did not help as it would have. Unlike the busy bustling of the everyday camp, there was a depressing gloom surrounding all the tents. The chatter between wives, and the lighthearted joking and teasing of the soldiers were replaced with hushed conversations and groans of pain. The whole camp felt empty after the battle.

I turned away from the gloominess and made my way to a particular hill that I had taken a liking to. It sat undisturbed with a solitary tree and overlooked the entire city of Veshyo. The land of corrupted beauty, the city was called. The most impressive city in Athos was named after the most shunned people in Athos. The *Veshya*, the renowned prostitutes, were an oddity. People avoided talking of them, yet they were still the most talked-about aspect of Athos. Corrupted Beauty it is. I sat down on the hill, looking at the city. Veshyo wasn’t razed as Yuvi had. Maybe Othusa had realized that if she burned every town, she went through, she wouldn’t have anything left.

And good thing she didn’t burn this one down. Even corrupted, the beauty of this city was undeniable. Glass towers mixed with white stone reflect every ray of light back to the onlooker. There was a certain order mixed in the chaos of the city. The large stone city center and glass stadium rose above the mayhem of city streets and houses. Even from afar, one could see the rhythm of the city change moving from one area to another. Unfortunately, the famed headquarters of the Veshyo was hidden from view by the massive Colosseum. Looking at the beautiful city, I even forgot to get back to Othusa. My heart refused to end this moment of solitude, but my body lead it away.

I reached Othusa’s tent soon. There was no one except for her. She lay inside on the bed, her hand still to her side, and her face twisted in pain. I bowed.

“It’s you,” she managed. “Come sit here.” She pointed to beside her on the bed.

Still bowed, I walked over to the side of the bed, but instead of sitting on the bed, sat next to it on the floor, head bowed, making no eye contact.

“Oh, don’t act like I’ve broken you. You’re still royal underneath this subservience. I’m cruel, but that doesn’t mean I can’t feel the hate and disgust radiating from under your cover of servitude,” she pulled my up by my hair to the bed. “Sit here and look up towards me.”

Othusa looked directly at me, her eyes unblinking.

“I know what you think about me. You probably think I am cruel disgusting. I won’t make my case to you. Still, I would like to show that I am not completely who you think you are. So today, you’re a free to speak what you will. I would like to know the mind of my ward.”

She looked at me, her eyes drilling into mine. But I refused to speak, refused to give her my emotions. My mind looking through many different possibilities of what this change indicated.

“Let me tell you a story. I was the fifth child in my family. I was to be a painter. I would love to sit down and paint people: father, mother, my brothers and sisters, the servants, father’s guests, and friends. I really embraced this art, the art of seeing and capturing the beauty of this world. And then one day, my sister died making me the next fourth daughter. Father burned all my books and paints away. You’re to be the next warrior he said. When I cried, he slapped me, and said a warrior doesn’t cry. After that, each day was torture, as they tried to rush the many years of training that my sister received into me.

“Do you know how the warrior’s school is like? All the children as they come of age are gathered into one place, a school. The older ones are in charge, and they beat us every day. The food went to the most resilient, the strongest after the beating. You had to earn your food by stealing it. If you couldn’t, then you didn’t deserve it. Even though I was older, I was counted as a novice. Kids many years younger than me would beat me and torture me. The older ones would use me for their fantasies. The older ones divided me, and my holes. One got my vagina, while another got my ass. There was one, the worst of them all. He gave me food, but after he used me. I would lay down on the table, and then he would shove his cock inside my mouth until I couldn’t breathe. Once he was done, he would make me swallow the food since I was too sore for chewing. One day I saw myself in the mirror, and saw this scrawny, little, ugly child, and I remembered when I was the collector of beauty. I changed.

“Do you know how I got through it? I laughed. I laughed at everyone at their face. After that it was breeze.” She laughed a maniacal laughter that made me shudder. “The one who used my pussy. He’s dead today. The other one, the one who used my ass. I cut his open last year. And the last one? I split his mouth open 5 years ago. When I got you. Do you know who that last one was? The worst one? Your brother.”

“My brother would never do anything like that,” I whispered tearing my eyes away from hers. She was lying. She was evil and vile. She only tells lies. But why would she?

“Look at me and say it.” Her hands reached for my face, and I moved away, but her strong grasp forced it towards her. “You don’t believe what you’re saying. You Yuvi dressed in your fineries only look good on the outside but hide what’s inside. At least by being cruel to you, I show you my true self.”

Her hands sloped down to my hands, caressing them. “But I have had some time for reflection. And I thought to myself, why do I want to become what your brother became of me? What I show to others, is it my true self, or the person that your brother and his friends have made me into? Today when I went into Veshyo, I realized who I am.”

Her hands moved down up my arm and towards my dress. She gently pulled it down my shoulder, slipping it off to reveal my naked chest underneath. Caressing my moderate breasts, she said, “You know I could have killed you, for all the wrong that your brother has done to me. But I didn’t. And I realized today why. Because deep down, I might still be that dreamer, the one who sees the beauty in others. You, Saetha, are beautiful. And I realized that I did not want to taint you, like the others that tainted me.”

She pulled her hands but moved in and planted a soft kiss on cheeks. “Go. You are to stay with Ayasedi and her mother in their tent.” She dropped down on her bed. Silent.

I sat there in disbelief for a few moments. I didn’t know what to think. I refused to accept those words of my brother. But the confession that I just heard did not seem artificial in the slightest. Just the vision of the tired Othusa changed my mind. The woman solemnly lay there, victorious but defeated, her eyes closed and chest heaving softly and steadily and even after all she’d done, I felt sorry for her.

“Thank you,” I whispered, and with a small bow got up to leave the tent. I rushed towards Ayasedi’s tent, as quickly as possible. It was small matter, but it was freedom, nonetheless.

I reached Ayasedi’s tent and found her mother alone. I went to her. “\ *Yuri*, maybe Fate does have better things in store for me. I am to live with you from now. A small victory. A small freedom.”

She looked at me, a smile on her face. “I am glad, child. Fate does have its ways. Yours have indicated better days as you hoped. Mine is not so simple.”

“What do you mean, *yuri*?”

“It doesn’t matter. Now it is about you. I would love to hear your story, child.”

And so, I did. It was strangely quite easy to talk to Dhoda. I told her about my life in Yuvi, my family and my people. I told of her our celebrations and festivals. I told her about the war and battle. And I also told her of Othusa and what she told me today. As the talks continued to their gloomy state, so did the weather outside. And then it started to rain, and I said, “I still wonder how Othusa has changed so?”

“Sometimes what fate ordains for you, someone else may get, while others may take on. In your case, someone else has gotten your fate.”

“Who?”

“You have not guessed?”

“Ayasedi? But why? How?”

“It is her duty. One that she has happily taken despite being shunned because of it.”

“She is a *Veshya*?”

“Yes, she is.”

“Why? Why would she choose such a fate?”

“Child, you do not choose your fate. Fate chooses you. It did so with me. And so, it did for Ayasedi.”

And then Ayasedi came. The previously poised, now wet, woman wore nothing on top. The *yarti* top she was supposed to wear was in her hands ripped. She looked tired, and not her old cheerful self. She walked over to her mother and laid down, resting her head on her lap. And Dhoda smiled.

Escape
======

“What shall we do to you?”

“You shall get nothing from me!”

“Oh? Is that so? We’ll see about that!” And with that Saisheta leaped onto the teenage girl with an onslaught of tickles.

“Stop! Stop!” Thisote said, giggling.

“Tell me! Hahaha!!” I laughed, continuing her playful biting and tickles.

“No, I shall not, you monster! Let me go or I shall destroy you!” Thisote kicked away. Finally getting rid of my hold, Thisote stepped back and haughtily said, “why you insolent! You dare threaten a princess! Why I shall have you imprisoned and tortured, stoned, used and humiliated by all the men in my kingdom in the town square!”

Saisheta’s grin turned into a frown. “You would do that to your own sister?”

Unexpectedly, Thisote rushed forward, and I was on the floor. Before I could counter the throw and get around to the girl’s side, Thisote ripped my top off and started biting at my breasts. The girl was unnecessarily strong. “Is this humiliating enough!”

Yet before this could continue, a stern voice shouted behind Thisote, “Thisote! Thisote, stop this instant! Othusa shall hear of this!”

She turned around to Ayasedi with a terrifying scowl. In that moment, I turned, throwing the girl off balance, and climbing on top of her,

“Enough! Ayasedi is right. This is not acceptable. One should never take play this far. I am your sister and what you did is completely inappropriate.” I got up and dragged the girl up firmly by hands. “I have told you multiple times to not get carried away. Last time, it was one of the servant boys you bruised while trying to duel with him, this time your own sister?”

“I am sorry, Saisheta. It’s just that I saw Ayasedi do that once to you, and you seemed to like it.” Ayasedi’s focus suddenly shifted to the curtains, and I felt my blood rush to my face. A million questions began to form. Did Othusa show Thisote on purpose? Did Thisote come upon them by accident? Had she seen Othusa watching?

“That was nothing that you think it was. Ayasedi was just…helping me with…it was just because they were hurting, and she knew a trick. It was nothing. You shall not repeat what you did to me, or anyone else. It is not appropriate,” I said through her pursed lips. “And you shall learn to keep yourself in check of your emotions. You get too wild when you are in the moment.”

“Yes, Saisheta. I am sorry.” So, it was an accident. And she hadn’t seen Othusa there. “Here let me wipe that off.” She reached for my breasts, but I stopped her.

“No. Leave it,” I said, grabbing a cloth to cover my breasts. “And apologize to Ayasedi as well.”

“But why h-I will, Saisheta. Sorry, Ayasedi.”

“There is not much harm done, I guess. We shall not go to Othusa this one moment. She will be much less lenient than us,” Ayasedi replied.

Of course, in truth, Othusa would have been much more lenient and maybe would have even encouraged Ayasedi to teach Thisote some techniques on some poor servant girl.

“Now rush along. Reflect on what you have done. And I repeat Thisote never again!”

“Yes, Saisheta!” And with that she ran off.

Ayasedi spoke again only after the girl was well out of earshot, “we shall need to be more careful. And Othusa must not hear of this.”

“Yes. Why have you come?”

“Othusa has called for you.”

“What for?”

“I am not sure.”

“Why are you so serious? You’re unlike yourself.” I indicated to her that we start walking. We stepped out of the room into the side hallway, walking slowly.

“I fear it is…that again.”

“It probably isn’t. We’ve had reports of the Saureshte mobilizing. It’s probably just that she wants to discuss it with me. She wouldn’t feel like it during war time.”

“I hope you’re right.”

“Why are you even so flustered by it? It’s not actually…is it? I mean, the only common link between us is Thisote. You only have your mother’s blood, and I, my father’s. Thisote has both of theirs. Thus, she calls both of us sisters, but that doesn’t mean we are.”

“The fact doesn’t make it less wrong. Yes, I was taught to do these things at the Academy with anyone and everyone, but not at this level?”

I stopped and grabbed the flustered Ayasedi by her shoulder. “Look, if both of us had our choices, then neither of us would be doing this. But you know Othusa and so do I. If we didn’t, imagine not what she would do to you, but to your mother, or Thisote?”

“I understand.”

“Good. Now get back to your usual cheery self. Smile a bit. Relax. Like I said, you’re probably worrying for nothing. It’s probably not even that.”

We walked into the room where Othusa was situated in front of other men, her generals. She sat in wood chair, looking much more tired but with an indignant look on her face that was no unusual. On her lap sat Dhoda, Ayasedi’s mother.

“This will cause us problems. We cannot use her now. She is of no use anymore, Othusa. I suggest we get rid of her,” one of the men around the table said. His face was starting to show signs of frustration. That happened around Othusa. “And as for this report, I advise you to look at it. There are chances that the Saureshte are planning to get rid of you once and for all.”

“You watch your mouth. Thisote was a leverage first. But she’s my daughter now. I will not abandon her. I will not hear of anything related to her. As for the Saureshte attacking us here, I think you better sit down and have a drink. They wouldn’t try anything like that especially with the festivals.” Othusa sat back, reaching for Dhoda’s breasts on her lap. “What is this, love? You know I don’t like the feel of this.” She pulled down the dress from Dhoda’s dress exposing her breasts to the men situated in the room.

Most of the younger officers swept their eyes away, while the older ones kept looking at the map not noticing a difference. Ayasedi pursed her lips but kept silent. Both knew not to say anything to Othusa, especially when Dhoda hadn’t said a word.

“This meeting is over. We have mulled over this horrid map for too long. Start the preparations for the festival. Enjoy yourselves.” She kneaded Dhoda’s breasts, and then took a long lick of her cleavage. “You might not find a woman as good as her but try and find one. You won’t regret it. Now off with you all.” As everyone left, she aggressively kissed and groped Dhoda. A grunt from Saisheta brought a pause to that.

“You’re here.”

“What do you need of me?”

“Just wanted to ask how the preparations for the festival tonight are going.” Othusa’s hand wandered towards Dhoda’s crotch. Othusa was one of those people who couldn’t keep themselves still. But Ayasedi seemed much more relaxed now that the others had left.

“The preparations are going quite well. Although the men are still tensed with the celebrating with the war. Maybe if you met with them…?”

“Nonsense. The men will relax once the festival is underway today.” She paused, as Dhoda let out a surprising moan. The room grew silent as Ayasedi, and I stood there watching. None of us said anything because there was nothing to say. But then Othusa spoke up, “I will send a notice throughout the camp, written by myself, to let my men know they need to relax. Will that be enough, Saisheta?”

“Yes, Othusa. Thank you.”

Othusa sprang up, nearly dropping Dhoda. “Excellent. Come with me. We shall write it right now.”

The sudden enthusiasm was surprising to not only me but everyone else in the room. Ayasedi’s normally calm demeanor seemed to hint at it, while Dhoda was the most, what with almost being dropped.

Othusa picked Dhoda up, tearing the rest of the dress off, and started walking towards her study bedroom with an unusually quick pace, giving rise to a growing suspicion inside me. She dropped Dhoda onto the large bed and moved towards Saisheta. The room seemed to grow colder as Othusa moved closer towards me.

“Now, Saisheta, I want you to relax. Strip. Let Aya relax you while I write the notice. Is that okay?” Her voice was soft, but she grinned a wide toothy grin that seemed to herald my dreads. And I understood. There was no question in the command. And Othusa’s command was not to be ignored.

I pulled off my clothes as slow as possible. The room seemed to get colder. The light outside that had previously been filtered into a light orange seemed to paint the room a blood red color now.

“Quickly now. Aya, help Saisheta out, will you?” Ayasedi moved towards me and slipped off my garments with a quick practiced hand, being careful to not touch my body, even though she knew of the inevitable.

I started moving towards the bed mechanically as soon as the last undergarment fell. Othusa’s soft bed yielded to my weight. It was uncomfortable. Especially for a body that was used to a soldier’s hard bed. I laid there, hands beside my body, and legs shut together, as the frigid air bathed my naked body, the soft sunlight pouring through the open window, not helping much. Ayasedi sat down and opened my legs.

She was not quick to bury her head in my crotch as commanded by Othusa, instead slowly adjusting herself on the bed, and then timidly using her tongue. I laid my legs on her shoulders, still covered by the softer *Veshya yarti*. I closed my eyes and just laid there, trying to stop any feelings from down there reaching my brain. It wasn’t difficult.

She stopped as Othusa said out loud, “Ayasedi, I’ll whip your beautiful body bloody if I don’t hear Saisheta exploding from pleasure. Why must I give you this encouragement every time I ask you to help Saisheta.” My body had started shivering of its own accord.

“Yes, Mistress.”

Her tongue sped, but only slightly. Only after a slight raise of my hips did Ayasedi quicken her pace. Her tongue reached out, less nervously now, towards places that few went to. I opened my eyes to see a wide-eyed apprehensive Ayasedi, licking tensely. I let out a fake moan, to the best of my abilities. And thus, went our farce.

Othusa did not seemed satisfied, though. “I grow tired of this.” She got up and picked Ayasedi up. She ripped apart the *yarti*, while her other hand found a long switch. Ayasedi cried out in pain as Othusa landed blows on her breasts and stomach. Long red swatches formed over her body. Othusa grabbed Ayasedi by her head and dragged her to the bed and pushed the flailing Ayasedi into my crotch. “I did not buy you, you whore, so that you may give me and my Saisheta some mediocre spasms. Have you been taught nothing in your pathetic school? Must I teach you everything?”

Othusa pushed the woman into my crotch with surprising painful force. Now Ayasedi’s tongue moved with a desperate frenzy. Othusa’s switch landed on Ayasedi’s exposed backside with a resounding slap.

“Why does her breasts remain dry! Dhoda! Fix this mistake!” A cry escaped from Ayasedi as another slap landed. Dhoda squatted next to me and started lapping at my breast while her hand massaged the other. I controlled the tears in my eyes and let out the moan that I had been holding back. There was no stopping the sensation now as Ayasedi and her mother released the full extent of her abilities.

“Dhoda, on top of her!” Othusa picked Dhoda up and placed her fully on top of me, and then moved back in switching poor Ayasedi. Dhoda’s soft body felt cold against mine, as her legs unconsciously wrapped around mine, pinning them. Her healthy body did not have much weight compared to my strength, but right now, her body felt heavy on my mind.

“Look at my Dhoda! She is working so hard. And yet her pussy is dry as the desert.” Her switch landed on Ayasedi again, her backside now painfully red. “Use your hands, you whore! Must I teach you everything!”

Dhoda immediately left my breast and let out a quite realistic moan. I let out another moan as I heard Dhoda. Ayasedi’s tongue slipped as Othusa let out another slap, and right there, my body started to tense, and resist against Dhoda’s body. I grabbed the bed sheet, as my hips ignored Dhoda’s weight and leapt up. Ayasedi’s hand pushed me down, but that was only slight effective as my legs started to shake. Othusa saw this and pushed Ayasedi’s head deeper into me, increasing the waves of convulsion flowing through my body.

Othusa pulled Ayasedi away as my body started to drop. “I should not… need to… do this… every time… Saisheta… needs to… relax.” Othusa’s switch landed precisely on a single spot on Ayasedi’s body. Tears rolled down Ayasedi’s eyes as Othusa grabbed her disheveled hair again and threw her on the floor.

“Without me, this time. And use your little equipment. I bet Saisheta would like it. Dhoda, come here. I must unwind.”

Ayasedi slowly moved towards the trunk and pulled out a replica penis. She pushed it the base end inside herself and walked over to me. Othusa crashed down beside me, pulling Dhoda to her while kissing deeply. The male Ayasedi sat on her knees near me and then nodded. She guided the shaft through my vagina, slowly and steadily. Once fully inside, she adjusted herself to lay on my completely, and started to slowly move her hips in circle. The shaft filling me shifted uncomfortably at first, but soon started to feel good.

I looked Ayasedi in her eyes and wrapped my hands around her encouragingly. Her hips moved of her own accord, occasionally thrusting, occasionally circling. I took Ayasedi and threw her to the side, giving me the freedom to move with her. Our arms and legs were entangled, hips swaying, and breasts touching, but there was no feeling of love. Just desperation, a waiting for when this can stop. Ayasedi broke the eye contact, laying her head on my shoulder. I could feel the wetness of her tears gliding down by shoulders.

Ayasedi continued swaying and soon she lifted my legs. Her hips now started to become faster. The occasional thrusts disappeared and was replaced by large, and fast motion that seemed to bring the object in me to regions that I hadn’t known existed. It seemed to fill me, and the movement made it seem larger than ever. My body started to shake, and my arms tightened around Ayasedi once more, pulling us closer. As more of her soft, cold skin came into contact with mine, my orgasm seemed to intensify. Again, my hips thrust towards her, as my muscles spasmed. Ayasedi barely kept my legs up, and kept up her motion, now thrusting in and out at a surprising speed. As my body started to relax, so did Ayasedi. She slowed down and finally rested the weight of hips onto me. A sigh escaped her.

Laying right beside me, I found Othusa looking at me, a satisfying grin in her eyes. Dhoda had positioned herself near the crotch of Othusa, lapping furiously. One of Othusa’s hands inched towards Ayasedi, inserting one of the fingers into the hole unoccupied by the replica. I felt the surprise course through Ayasedi’s body. She pulled out Ayasedi’s hips by the anus, pulling her away from me. She moved towards Ayasedi into a kiss, finger still in her anus.

“Why do need me to show you every time, Aya?” Her fingers pushed up into Ayasedi’s anus, pulling her up with a gasp of pain. “You are mine. So, follow my orders. *To the best of your ability*.” Her hands violent shook Ayasedi’s hips, again eliciting a gasp. “Or do you have something against my Saisheta?” And then she stopped. Pulling her hands away from Ayasedi altogether. “

“No, Othusa. I mean you no disrespect, nor to Saisheta.”

“Still. No clothes for the rest of the day as punishment. Maybe I should also have you give this experience to Thisote. She has definitely grown enough and might even need it.” Ayasedi stayed silent. “But not today. Leave me now. I must enjoy my Dhoda.”

Ayasedi scrambled out of bed after me and exited the room with surprising alacrity. I slowly clothed myself with Othusa’s moans in the background. Outside the room, Ayasedi hadn’t left.

“Escort me to my room please, Saisheta. And could you cover me? I know what I am, but I’d rather not expose myself to every passerby in the estate,” Ayasedi whispered, her eyes near the doorway where Othusa’s moans could still be heard. I nodded, and we commenced an awkward shuffle into her room. It was unnecessary as no one appeared. Nevertheless, Ayasedi seemed a lot more relaxed when we neared the small alcove that she shared with Saetha.

Saetha sat on the bed, spinning cloth, when we entered. Her concern was clear when she saw Ayasedi nude and with me. She knew what happened. Almost everybody knew, but they pretended it was a rumor rather than reality. But no one questioned nor slighted Othusa.

Saetha took Ayasedi and placed her on the bed. “Thank you, Saisheta.”

“You do not need to thank me. Aya is good friend. And the only reason I do not call her my sister is because that would twist what Othusa makes Aya do.” She nodded.

“Come. Let us get something for these bruises.” She motioned me to go outside as she covered Ayasedi in a blanket.

“Was it bad?” she said, looking at me with those purple eyes.

“Worse… than last time.”

“She is brave. I know what Othusa is like.” Her pace seemed to grow timid and more uncertain with only the mention of Othusa.

“We talked about it. I told her what we do isn’t wrong. But her ideology comes in the way of pleasing Othusa. I do not know how I can show her that that reluctance is what is getting her this treatment.”

“You’re right in your own way, and she is in hers.”

“Saetha, that which saves her from this suffering is righter. I only wish the best for her.” Anger seemed to rise inside me. I could feel the path the tears made running down my shoulder. “At the end of the day, she is forced to do this anyway. Why the reluctance which only harms her.”

“I don’t know.” Saetha’s head hung low. “I need to ask you a favor.” We stopped in front of the dispensary.

“Anything.”

“I know what will make Aya feel better. Can you help me get Strai tonight?”

“I can make that happen. Just have to distract Zhisu for tonight and tomorrow morning. Enough that he doesn’t notice Strai missing. I’ll send a few men to do that. And then I can sneak Strai into your room. I’ll go talk to her.” I turned around to leave, but Saetha wasn’t done.

“Oh, and I need another favor.”

“What else?”

“I’m going to need another place to stay tonight.” We both burst into laughter.

--------------

I was already out of bed and heading towards Ayasedi’s room at dawn. Zhisu had fallen from his drinks, but slowly everyone was coming to from the festivities. Strai would need to be home for Zhisu to not notice of her absence.

The door to the room was closed, even though not many would come at night to Othusa’s private quarters. You wouldn’t want to be caught sneaking when the commander was in midst of her private moments. I opened it with the key Saetha had given me.

The two defiant lovers were still asleep, arms and legs crossed, even in sleep, looking at each other. Their open hair, and a large wet spot on the sheets showed an enjoyable night. I knocked on the door to wake them, which prompted Strai to shoot up and cover herself with the bedsheet. She sighed a relief when she saw it was me. Ayasedi, on the other hand, was much more relaxed, and even let out a smile when she saw me.

“Strai, it’s time to go. Zhisu must not notice you were away.” She nodded and got up to dress after giving Ayasedi a quick kiss.

Once they were both dressed, I led them to my quarters, where Saetha sat waiting.

Ayasedi and Strai said their farewells in silence, trying to avoid showing their obvious affection, but failing.

We walked the length of the courtyard back to the soldier’s quarters where Strai stayed with her husband. Neither of us said anything, yet a looked crossed Strai’s face: a faint blink that lasted longer, a slight nod, and a faint hint of a *Thank you*. I smiled.

Ayasedi was in a much better mood when I returned, a wide smile on her face, excitedly talking about what she wanted to do the rest of today. That’s when the horn sounded. The fortress was under attack. Immediately, the buildings sprung back to life as soldiers awakened from their night of celebrations. Even then, they slogged, an obvious sign of their previous inebriation. Othusa had been right: they dared not attack during the festival, but who was to say they couldn’t after. It was one of the few times I had seen her fail.

“The horn sounded from the north. Go to the western gate. Even if they were to flank us, they would do so from the east or south. You should be safe there. Quickly!” I sprang into action as fast as my mind allowed me. I started to leave, rushing towards Othusa where my loyalty lay, despite the happenings of yesterday.

“Saisheta!” yelled Aya. She was reluctant to leave. Her body turned towards me even though she was pulled by Saetha. Her face was scrunched in worry. “Mother? Strai?”

“Don’t worry, Aya. Mother will be fine. I will keep her safe. As for Strai, I will try my best.” I tried to smile confidently, yet I can only imagine what it came out to be. She seemed to relax a little, and then let Saetha pull her away with some reluctance.

I rushed out of the small dwelling and ran back to Othusa’s residence with my single sword and a heavy heart. I hijacked a few men who were rushing towards their post, and we marched as fast as we could.

We found Othusa in her room relatively safe with a crying Thisote in her arms, and Dhoda to the side, surprisingly quiet and calm.

“Those fucking whores attacked now! Where did Roshra’s mighty honor go?” Her angry words certainly reflect the calm demeanor that she showed to Thisote. “Don’t worry Thisote. Everything will be fine. You see, Saisheta is here.”

She beckoned me forward, and a quick flash of worry showed in her face before she pulled Thisote away from her chest and into my arms.

“Saisheta, I don’t need you to lead today. I need you for something much more important. The Saureshte have launched an attack from the north, but that’s not where they attacked. That was a distraction. I posted guards in the north, south and east, but instead they came down the swamp in the west of all the places!

Take Thisote and Dhoda and head towards the east, and over the mountains. You should be safe there. Wait for my signal when everything is safe. And then you can come down. Dhoda, take Thisote and pack as much as you can.”

I cursed to myself softly. I had sent Aya and others towards the attack rather than away. They will have to fend for themselves now, but nevertheless, I sent a prayer to our family god that I had long abandoned to give them, my new family, strength.

Othusa sat up and gestured for her helpers to start equipping her. The battle outside grew louder as soldiers seemed to be pushing closer and closer to the commander’s residence.

“Come closer, Saisheta. She has gone, hasn’t she? Thisote? Yes. Good. I need to tell you the truth. I didn’t see this. I admit I was too confident… in my abilities as well as my generals. I will try to make it right, but there is a chance I will fail.” Othusa’s voice was grave. Softer and more serious than I had ever heard. It sounded almost like the voice of someone who had accepted their end. “You will see my signal when it comes, Saisheta. But I am afraid that there is a chance that it might not come at all. I which case, I would like you to take Thisote away, and raise her somewhere safe and away from this. Tell Ayasedi and Dhoda that they are free from any obligations towards me. I trust you, Saisheta. Please. Promise to keep them safe.”

“Till the end, my Lady.” I knelt down and kissed her right hand and right feet. “If… If you are to fall, I shall serve your last words as I have your living words.”

A single tear dripped from her eyes, and she took me into an embrace, one unlike any I had felt. An embrace not from her master to servant, but one from a dying friend another.

“Go, and don’t tell Thisote of this. She must not live with the fact that I had given up.”

And finally, with a wave of her hand, she dismissed me.

Lust

Part 1
------

The younger girl was enjoying the attention she was receiving from the strangers we had met so far. The way they talked, walked, and looked, the sheer abnormality of the whole situation, while entertaining for the youngster, was a touch overwhelming for me. And yet, by some unknown means, the people here understood and did not approach me. Or they were simply equally enraptured by Thisote to approach the other uninteresting alien. The place itself was otherworldly. Unlike the military austerity that I had experienced for the years with Othusa, and the poor conditions in the Saureshte camp, this place was an overload on every sense imaginable. Thick fumes wafted over from every corner, every smell a different feeling. There were little sources of light, yet everything, from the ceiling to the clothes of the attendees, seemed to reflect the light, scattering them into many colors, illuminating the vast room. And the room itself, filled to the brim with the rich and wealthy and their servants, tenfold in amount, were not enough to make the hall seem full. Rather it made it seem grander.

“You seem… Please… with me. [13]_” A voice said behind me, which combined with the crowd, and my loose grasp of the language, I only half understood. I turned around to see Yona standing behind me, waving me to follow her. The woman, if you could call her that, was decked in brightly colored clothing with literal gems hanging from every loose cloth. Her dress consisted of many loose clothes draped around her shoulders, with clothes wrapped around her waist to keep them from falling when she walked. While her dress used so much cloth, it still managed to reveal her well endowed chests, something that would be entirely unacceptable back home. She had tried to get me to wear something similar, yet I was too affixed to tradition to try it. Neither had Thisote, in the beginning. Yet slowly, she had started to accept the customs.

I followed Yona up to the balcony where many other patrons sat drinking or eating. She kept talking in her usual soft voice, and yet I could barely hear the words that she said. Occasionally she would greet someone or shoo away a curious servant. One graciously offered me some food, which I did not refuse. This seemed to please them a lot as they pumped up their chest and walked away with a spring in their step. I smiled.

There had been a few things that were much different when we had first been introduced to the Sassandrian society. There were trivial things, like the importance of serving tea to a guest. They way they kissed on the cheek after introductions. At one point, after you had been well acquainted, they would move to hugs, and kissing the shoulder. In Athos, one would be incredibly careful with the amount of eye contact one made to another. In general, theirs was a very tactile society. Yet the biggest cultural shock had been the various state of undress which was considered normal here.

In such a ball, clothes were meant less to cover oneself and more for showing off the materials of your cloth. Clothes were not worn even outside the bedroom. Yet, people barely got clothed when someone came into your home. Although people did not roam around fully undressed, which at any point would be surprising now if it did happen, strict restrictions on clothing was much less of a likelihood here than in our home world.

My thoughts were finally broken when we arrived at the balcony for Yona.

“Sit,” she said. The balcony, a large room, half out overlooking the floor below, and half inside the building, already had 3 chairs furnished with many furs and cloth over it. A wide variety of food had already been arranged around it. “There is no one here now. You can relax.”

I sat down breathing a little softer. “Thank you.”

“Tell me of your world again,” Yona said, getting settled, sliding off some of the robes. I was getting much more used to the nudity, especially of Yona, although I still couldn’t go around exposing myself. “Did your world have such beautiful clothes and food?”

“Of course, not Yona, Nothing that would compare to what you have here. Of course, I was never truly as wealthy as you are in our world. But Thisote surely was, and as you can see, even she enjoys herself more here than there.”

She laughed. “I see. But tell me about you? What did you do?”

“I… I was a seamstress. I used to make clothes for the people there.”

“I see. What kind of clothing did you make? Would you make some for me if I got the materials for you?”

“I’d be delighted to, but I don’t believe they would be suitable for one such as yourself. And they are much too modest. Look at your beautiful self. Why would it want to be decked in the drab clothing of my world?”

“No, you must. I insist.” And then there was a knock on the door to the balcony. A Ranthisian insolently barged in, breasts swinging,

“My lady, I wish to present myself as the first partner of Lady Strai, this evening.” I looked at Yona. This Ranthisian was the first one of many in the evening. She was one of countless that had come before, requesting access to me.

“The lady is unavailable as of today. She is tired from the festivities, and she wishes to relax.”

“I assure you, Yona, that she will thoroughly enjoy herself with me. Maybe she may change her mind once she sees my body. Moreover, her kind have little interaction to perform. Lady Strai’s companion has been with me many times, and she has had little need to perform with one of our kind.”

“There is no doubt that you may be the best partner she may have this evening, but -”

I had lost track of the conversation at that point, the pleading of the Ranthisian, and the desperate attempts of Yona to convince her otherwise. At the point, I remembered Thisote’s proposition. *Marry me. If you do, the propositions will stop. The Ranthisian have a different concept of marriage. They will accept your marriage with me, and moreover, once you have been declared mine, no one shall attempt to move towards you,* she had said. *I will still be able to enjoy myself, but you’ll be safe. Away from the advances, ever faithful to your Aya.*

The Ranthisian, now fully unclothed, was accusing Yona. “I see what is happening Yona. You wish to keep her for yourself. Thisote has already left you and realized others younger. And so, you keep Lady Strai for yourself. Don’t worry, Lady, I shall finally show you the time of your life.”

I raised my hand. “I believe you have been mistaken. Yona keeps me not for herself, but for someone else. I have given my heart to Thisote, and I sleep only with her. Please go now, so as not to embarrass me any further.”

The Ranthisian had a mixture of curiosity and disappointment picked up her clothes and left.

“I thought that you were unhappy with Thisote’s proposal,” Yona said once the Ranthisian had gone.

“And yet, what that insolent youngster said to you changed my mind. I cannot wish to keep myself locked away without some kind of rational reason. And this seems to be the only good reason.”

I looked down from the balcony. It had started. The dazzling clothes had been discarded, and young and old alike had started to intimately mate, without any restrictions of emotional or contractual relation. Among them was Thisote herself, laid on a table surrounded by the ever-curious Ranthisians as one by one they waited to enjoy themselves as well as enjoy her.

==============

This was the best part of the evening. With the Ranthisians bodies surrounding me, and one filling me. They laughed and joked, while waiting to put their distinctly male members into my female body. The constant movement was an inconvenience, but a minor one. The constant movement inside of me, the feeling of being filled up, the occasional hand exploring my arms and legs and stomach, which was where true enjoyment lay.

“I adore your breasts, Thisote. May I?”

“Is there any need to ask, Kaire,” I said while being pounded, to which she immediately launched onto my nipples. I pushed her head deeper in reply. I laughed my heart out. Where in Athos would this be possible. Even Othusa, who was so liberal compared to her contemporaries could not imagine such an event. I could hear other such people around me, enjoying themselves, or pleasuring others. In the few moments I had of rest, I would watch the other couples, the more adventurous kinds. And the positions, and number of people in the act. It seemed astoundingly unnatural but looked incredibly fun.

The old cock that was previously inside me, at this point I had no idea which one was which, left and was soon replaced by another one. This one was slightly smaller, but it curved, hitting me places where no other could reach.

I groaned, “Kaire!” as she stopped her assault on my breasts. Instead, she climbed up on my stomach and slapped her abnormally large penis right in between my breasts.

“I saw my father do this to mother [14]_. It looked fun. Here, push your breasts together.” And with that, she started thrusting her penis through my breast’s cleavage. The skin of her penis was rough, or at least more than my skin’s. It probably felt incredibly good to her, hence the increase in speed. The Ranthisian pounding me behind her probably helped as she didn’t have to move a lot.

Kaire was one of the so-called Blessed. Born near the start of a year, Kaire was one of the special Ranthisians to be born with the Blessing of Long Limbs. Thus, she had arms, legs and a penis that were at least twice as long as a normal Ranthisian. And considering how large penises came in Ranthis, Kaire was well-endowed compared to any man in Athos, although I hadn’t seen many in my time in Athos. Only a few fleeting glimpses of when some general came over, and Dhoda had entertained them.

My attention returned back to Kaire when she slapped her penis on each of breasts again. Each of her thrusts required much more movement than normal, and each of them thrust right into her face reaching all the way to my eyes before returning back. She laughed as I tried to lick her penis as it approached my face, although I was more unsuccessful than no.

“So Kaire, why is it that so many of you like to come to me? You all have a set of vaginas just as I? Why do you enjoy me more? Ohhh,” I yelped as another left my body, and one entered my ass instead of my vagina. Either they didn’t seem to notice, or it had happened intentionally, but they continued the thrusting. It was slightly uncomfortable, but only for some time, before it got surprisingly enjoyable. “I can’t even return the favor for you?”

“You’re different. I can’t explain it. It’s your-” she stopped as she thrust back her head. Her whole body tensed and tightened before finally she shot a distinct purplish light blue liquid shot out of her penis and straight onto my face. “Oops sorry.”

“No problem. I like your taste anyway.” We both laughed, mine interlaced with an orgasm of my own as the tip reached way in the back. My body convulsed as the others around me cheered and slapped the Ranthisian pounding me on the stomach as congratulations. I smiled and gave her breast a squeeze as acknowledgement. “You were saying something.”

“You’re simply different. You have a grip that we don’t find amongst ourselves. I don’t know how to explain it. Every time we enter you, instead of feeling the soft innards of a person, we feel more… like hundreds of hands caressing us, trying to push everything out. At least that’s why I’ve heard others say. Unfortunately, I haven’t had the chance. But then there’s your beautiful body. Half the fun is looking down at your shaking breasts. They are so much softer than ours,” she said while pushing her own up. She was right. Ranthisian breasts were smaller, more compact. They didn’t bounce as much. Nor were they as sensitive as mine.

“Hey, Thisote. You think you’re done for today? I really want to shoot myself into you.”

“Uhhh, not really, Gidi. But you can still do it. I don’t really mind. And I don’t think I’m capable of giving birth with your kind, so your custom isn’t needed on me.”

“Custom is custom, Thisote. I’ll just go in Kaire here.”

“Don’t you dare. I’m going to stay in here as long as Thisote is here.”

“Well, it’s going to be you, inside or outside.” And with that, Gidi pulled out of me, and shot her load straight onto Kaire, shaking her penis, and coloring her stomach and my breasts.

“I don’t know how you come up with so much, and I’m glad you didn’t put it in me. I’d be full,” I said, giving Gidi’s cock a good squeeze to pull the rest out.

“I’m sure you could take it.”

Right then, Riqari came from the balcony halls, striding straight towards me. “Come Thisote, I have to take you today.”

Riqari was a strange person. I didn’t really like her as much. For one, she was too rough sometimes, and demanding. She always acted too entitled, although that was mostly because she came from the richest family in Sassandria. But I didn’t really have a choice as she forcefully flipped me to my stomach and entered me with full force.

“And why is that?” I said, holding back some anger at being mishandled.

“Why, because soon you may not come to us at all, but instead spend more time with your wife.”

“My wife?”

“Don’t act so surprised.” She turned to the others gathered around Thisote. “Thisote is the reason we do not get to enjoy the Lady Strai. She has given herself to Thisote. Why Thisote must take every good thing from us. Such a body, and that of her beautiful partner Strai.”

“And who told you such a thing, Riqari?”

She knelt down and whispered, “Lady Strai herself. I will have her with or without your or her permission,” before making a final thrust and pouring a percent of the liquid by Gidi into Thisote. A burning rage seemed to fill me at those words. “Here’s your early wedding gift. Now out of here. Your day is done.”

I kicked the fool out of me and grabbed at her neck. “YOU BASTARD!” In my rage, punches flew towards the surprised recipient with the strength of a trained fighter. The people of Sassandria were not fighters and especially not Riqari. The first punch threw the Ranthisian off, and second elicited a waterfall of blood onto Thisote’s chest.

Immediately, a crowd gathered around the fight, and Kaire advanced towards the pair trying to break them. I got a few more punches in before Kaire managed to speak to me out of it. A screaming Riqari coughed blood on one side with a broken nose, and a bruised stomach, unable to say anything. Good thing too, or she definitely might have said something that would make her condition worse than it is right now. Blood dribbled down my chest and onto my thighs mixing in with the little liquid that had caused the altercation. But of course, that wasn’t the real reason for the altercation.

“What happened to you, Thisote? You know such fighting is below us.”

“Riqari here assaulted my freedom, and thus I assaulted her. She came into me without my permission.”

“That is not reason enough to harm someone. You may stay here and enjoy yourself for longer. I think we can forgo custom for our other worldly guest here. And I may decree so as part of the host family.” Kaire approached Thisote trying to coax her back to the table, yet Thisote softly but firmly pushed her out of the way.

“I do not wish to. Riqari has ruined my mood.” I fled the scene before the rage subsided and the overwhelming murmurs got to me.

I could see all the faces following me to Yona’s balcony in my peripheral.

Soon enough the pervious sounds of the ball resounded through the halls as people resumed their activities.

Strai bolted up as she saw my state. “What happened to you?”

“Nothing, Strai. It’s not mine.” She started to take cloth lying around and wiping off the blood on my body.

“Well, something obviously happened, otherwise you wouldn’t be covered in blood.” She continued to carefully wipe the blood off my body. She seemed to have gotten a little comfortable with the free nature of this society, although she hesitated when she got to my crotch. Yona still stood there a little shocked. It took a little longer for her to get over the sight, yet when she did, she even smiled, looking at the concern Strai showed for me. I smiled back, hesitantly.

“I said nothing happened. Yona, let us leave now. I am done for the day if you are.”

“You are? But the night is young, my dear. We can stay for a little while.”

“No. We go,” I said resolutely. “And I may need some of your clothes.”

“Very well. You can take some of mine. I was getting a little stuffy wearing so much anyways.” She rang for her servant to prepare the carriage.

No one spoke as Strai finished cleaning the blood, and I loosely draped some of Yona’s traps around my body. Kaire came in as we were about to leave, her stomach still coated with the dry liquid of Gidi.

“You are leaving? I had hoped to convince you of staying.”

“I wish to leave, and I will not be swayed.”

“Look, Riqari has started talking back again, and she is spreading lies. You must stay back to defend yourself. I know what she says is false, but others will not be so inclined to keep your trust in you.”

“Kaire, tell me what has happened?” Yona finally spoke.

“Thisote has not said. Thisote bloodied Riqari, supposedly for inseminating her without her permission, although Riqari is saying she did so because of the pleasure Thisote derives from violence. Supposedly, it comes from Thisote’s otherworldly blood that causes the violence. Now, she is even saying that Thisote’s kind are Hopa worshipers.”

“This is absurd!” Yona seemed disturbed by this. “Thisote why did you not tell me about your altercation earlier. Fights like this are probably common in your world, but it may have dire consequences for you here. It is good Kaire told me of this, so I might start taking the necessary actions to protect you. Kaire, how bad was it?”

“All the blood on Thisote was Riqari’s.”

Yona’s face, which had previously lightened, was now filled with concern and stress. “This will be more difficult than I had thought,” she slowly said. “Very well, let us go, Thisote.”

“Please, wait for me. I shall come with you.”

“There is no need, Kaire,” Yona said, shaking her head.

“I insist. The gathering shall be attended by the rest of my family members.” Yona did not deny it further.

And thus, we walked down amid a buzz of people to Yona’s carriage.

Part 2
------

The carriage ride was most uncomfortable. The carriage, an elegantly carved, wooden box on wheels, was not the problem, although quite annoyingly we had elected to take the smaller carriage for four people: Yona, Thisote, me and the servant that Yona had brought along with us. It was when Kaire joined us did the situation become uncomfortable.

Yona and her master servant sat together, while the still nude and soaked in dried semen Kaire squeezed between me and Thisote. Moreover, the bumping carriage ride occasionally flopped Kaire’s massive member on my thighs.

Now, I had gotten used to the nudity in this place, but a Ranthisian’s member touching me was new and extremely uncomfortable. So, I was more than pleased when Thisote took it off and started looking at it with wonder.

“You know I haven’t gotten a chance to admire you in all your glory. It’s usually in someone, or on top of me where I can’t see it properly,” she said, rolling it between her hands. “Does it ever go limp?”

“It is limp.”

“By Anket! Have you seen anything like this in your day, Yona?”

And she was right. The thing was longer than my forearm. Compared to this, my husband’s member had been puny, not even a considerable fraction. It made me wonder how one could fit the whole thing in a woman’s body.

“No, I haven’t. It is truly remarkable,” Yona said, incredulously. Her expression did not change much nowadays. “Although I have seen one quite thick. Back then when I was a much younger woman [15]_ I encountered one whose width was equal to the width of my hand.” She indicated on her hand. “Yet to be honest, it only made you feel full, but not good. It stretched you out, painfully so in the beginning, but it did not reach to the back where real pleasure lies. You, Kaire, have been blessed with the reach to cause the most pleasure.”

“Thank you for your words, Yona,” she smiled, pushing her chest out in pride. “And Lady Strai, why are you so quiet? Do you not like it?”

“No, no, Kaire. It truly is wonderful. A gift from nature. I too have seen nothing close to this in my short life.”

“Please, then I request you to touch it at least once. I have been told that you haven’t had the chance to even peek a Ranthisian member, much less accept one. That is, once Thisote has had enough of it.” Kaire glared at her, who at this point was childishly fiddling around with skin on the tip.

“I am fine. Truly. To be honest, you have all been extremely gracious to us visitors, but please do not look unkindly at one who has come from a more modest upbringing for whom such show is… different.”

“I agree, Lady Strai. But everyone must change. You see how Thisote has taken to us. I would just like you to experience our kind before you are closed off with your marriage to Thisote.” Thisote blinked at that, though Kaire didn’t seem to notice.

“Uhhh, yes, Strai. I wouldn’t mind,” she said, quite innocently, though I could see the mischief behind her eyes. It faded quickly as I glared at her.

“I believe Kaire is right in her own regards. Allow us the hospitality before you are forbidden to do so. Or else the Aidi might be disappointed with us,” Yona calmly said, quickly followed by, “but please take your time and consider it. I’m sure Kaire would be happy to come to you not just now but any other time. Yet it is important for your consent to be present.”

“Just call on me when you feel right. I shall be there. As for me, I cannot wait to see your body that you so consistently hide from us. From what little my eyes can discern you seem much more beautiful than Thi- OW! That hurts!” she shrieked and slapped Thisote’s hand which had pulled back Kaire’s skin and had been fiddling with the duct from whence the Ranthisian equivalent of semen came from. “Your Kaire-cock privileges have been taken,” Kaire said, slapping her penis away from Thisote.

Unfortunately for me again, it landed on my thighs. And then, just for a moment, I thought of accepting. Yes, I loved Aya. I had been faithful to her. From the time that we had been discovered to when we met again in the marketplace of Yuvi. The moments I had been unfaithful were those that were forced upon me. The husband that I was given, the one who loved me for nothing more than my body and my ability to give him a child, was a mistake forced upon me by society. Why, when I had been constricted by society, should I not for once think about myself? Why should I not indulge in a service that one has so kindly offered, without guile? Would be even faithlessness if the union shall only be between two bodies and not two minds? A union that will ultimately cause no progeny. Wasn’t that the reason that the concept of faithlessness was created in the first place? So that one man might have control of a woman’s orifices.

But what would Ayasedi think? She would understand. Her job was to please people, sexually. She did this for others, and I never took offense. I loved her for who she was, a cheerful, good person who fell into a role without a choice. What would she say if I gave into temptation and had a physical union just once of my own accord?

My mind raced of its own accord. Yet I stayed silent. I would not give into temptation until I had known the answers to my question.

==============

I would give anything to know what was happening inside Strai’s mind. What discussion she was having with herself. The same person, who moments ago had an expression of pure terror when Kaire’s penis had flopped onto her lap, now sat silently staring out into this distance, the same penis rolling around quite happily near the one place it would probably never be allowed to enter.

I noticed both Yona and Kaire looking at me while I watched Strai, but I said nothing, and neither did they. And thus, we were all locked: Strai, thinking her unkown thoughts, me, admiring the beauty that was soon to be mine, and Yona and Kaire, two bystanders who had unknowingly helped me fulfill a dream that they knew nothing about. A dream that had begun so many years ago in a dirt-ridden hovel, surviving day to day with the woman who I watched.

Everyday she would sit down on her stool, spinning cloth, or weaving them into beautiful blankets, or long, elegant *yartis* but unable to afford one herself. She hadn’t known me from Othusa’s camp, nor had I known her. Only when we had found her when we fled, did I learn of her, I learned of her relationship with Ayasedi. At first, it had felt unnatural. A woman loving a woman? Of course, Mother had slept with Ayasedi and Dhoda, but that was different. They were meant to be used, and only because there hadn’t been any male prostitutes to exist. One had to make do.

The first few months, I had only felt disgust towards her, even though both Dhoda and Saisheta seemed to be quite attached to her. Dhoda had started doing what she was best at. Her body might not have been as young, but her skills remained. I had liked to think it was because of Othusa.

Slowly, I had come to like her. It was because of the silent sacrifices she had made, the moments of laughter that we had unknowingly shared, the times she had sided with me in my fights with Dhoda, or Saisheta. Once the smile that I had found disgusting just because of who she liked had changed me, made me become more like her. After that, I yearned to be with her, I tried to make her forget Ayasedi, to look to me, to notice me. This feeling, it grew worse as I got older, but that didn’t make it bad.

We slept in a small hovel with barely enough space for two people much less for four. Yet what was once torture became a heaven that I was fortunate to so receive. For it was during those times, when Dhoda slept with a client and Saisheta left to attend to another one of those late-night meetings with her revolutionaries, could I sleep close to Strai. When in the small space that counted for our bedroom, kitchen, and bathroom, I could snuggle up to her, feel her. Her soft body touching my growing one, her arms that she wrapped around me, holding me close. It took me all my strength not to lunge at her, to kiss her to my hearts desire, to tell her that I loved her.

But I didn’t. I played the long game: to convince her to love me in a way that even she didn’t know she was being convinced. And I was succeeding. She talked with me instead of Saisheta, or Dhoda. She called for me to help her instead of either of the two. Even when the other two were there, she would snuggle up to me, sleep next to me. She would kiss me each night before going to bed with me in her arms. I had almost gotten her. Then she came: Ayasedi. And all that I had achieved was gone in a single instant.

The hugs that I had gotten were replaced with kisses to Ayasedi. Not the kisses on the cheek that she gave me, but real kisses. My body burned when I saw that. It burned when I saw her hold Ayasedi’s hand. My body burned every time she talked with Ayasedi, cried in front of her, cried on her chest. The soft touch of her hands had left me to be on my sister. The same sister who had changed, becoming a different person altogether. Not even a person, but a creature. But most of all, it burned with the rage of the whole universe that one night. When far from the city, under the light of the purple moon, I saw the two. Strai under the 6-limbed creature, laughing, moaning, enjoying herself. Enjoying herself with someone other than me.

I remembered that as I saw her now, her face lighted by the faint sun rays filtered through the light curtains of the rocking carriage. Finally, I had triumphed. Separated from Ayasedi, she was mine, and I would make sure it stayed that way.

“You look like a fool you know. She will be yours in suitable time, so stop your drooling,” whispered Kaire with a jab of her elbow. I startled awake.

“Uhhh, yes. Of course,” I smiled, slapping her breasts jokingly. In the meantime, I would enjoy the bodies of these aliens.

We arrived to Yona’s estate soon after, a sprawling manor built at a grand scale even for a Ranthisian. Supposedly it was an ancient structure built by a wealthy Dragonvolk, creatures similar to a Ranthisian but of mixed genetics. They were larger than normal Ranthisian, grew horns out of their heads, and had wings for hands. They came in many assorted sizes. The one who had built the mansion was supposedly massive, thus the grand scale. Those I had met were much smaller. Yet the most important part about the Dragonvolk was their breast milk. The clear breast milk of a Dragonvolk that had not yet given birth could be distilled into a heavenly drink found nowhere in the universe much less Athos.

We exited the carriage into a courtyard lined with statues of famous Ranthisians in various states of undress, in various positions. The biggest one was a fountain statue of a Ranthisian screaming towards the sky as water flowed out of all her orifices: her breasts, her penis, vagina, and anus.

A host of servants flooded us, taking our clothes from our shoulders. Another saw Kaire’s state and gave her a wet towel with which to clean herself. By this time, they had recognized that Strai wished to keep some of her clothes on, even in the house. While previously she remained in her full attire, she had slowly started to loosen. Now she wore only a thin shift, considered the underwear in Athos, that still covered all of her skin.

“Let us disperse for the rest of today. I need time to think. We shall talk of what happened and what will do tonight. And Kaire, please stay with us tonight, maybe even till the next gathering. I am sure Thisote would love to have you. And it will do her good to have such a more mannered Ranthisian company and not the lowly workers she goes to visit on her free time.”

“I would be happy to accept your invitation. I will surely stay. Please, would you send word to my family so they may not worry.”

“Of course. I shall be on my way now. Enjoy.”

Yona walked away, arm in arm with her first wife and *her* pregnant second wife who had just arrived.

Kaire turned towards me and Strai with a wide smile. “So, what shall we do?”

“I’m not sure. Do you have any ideas?”

“Yes, but only if Lady Strai agrees to accompany us.”

Strai blinked awake again. She seemed to be lost in her thoughts more and more. “I’m not sure if I should. I need more time to consider.”

“No, no, Strai. I shall not ask you to do anything you might not agree to, until you do. I only ask that you watch us. It maybe so that my idea may convince you,” she said, moving towards Strai, and even grabbing her hand. Strai broke the eye contact that Kaire had maintained. “Or is watching not part of your culture either?”

I moved to part her, but Strai did it herself. “It is not, but I agree that I may shed some of my past and enjoy your culture. To that end, I shall watch. Now, what is this idea of yours?”

“Follow me. I shall explain on the way. I hope you’re not tired of carriage, because we may need to use it again for a short ride,” she said, quickly walking back towards the gate. Her quick gait surprised us. She even picked up her hanging cock which slapped her thighs when she walked. Combined with her extra long legs, we quickly fell behind, but caught up again at the carriage. I looked at Strai who shrugged with her shoulders. We got into the carriage where Strai quickly picked the side opposite of Kaire and her large cock. “Well, it is less an idea, and more of introducing to you an indulgence of mine.

“Not to brag, but of course you know I am rather popular because of my Blessing. Yet occasionally, I myself have need of something my own size. And so-”

“Here’s an option,” I interrupted. I pushed her back on the open seat before she could resist, not that the Ranthisian could have done anything even if she resisted against the much stronger Thisote. I grabbed the hanging cock and curved it back into the woman’s own vagina.

“THISOTE!” She jumped up quickly, the tip of the limb cock still inside her. It quivered and shot out of her. She grabbed the end and fell back.

Strai jumped up with a surprising amount of concern. “Kaire, are you okay? Thisote why don’t you think before you act. How could you do something like this!” Even more surprisingly she moved Kaire’s hand off her member and examined it, the same way she would look at my wounds whenever I got hurt. My cheeks burned red. Yet as soon as it happened, she realized what she had done, and pulled her hands back with blush red cheeks. “Are you okay?”

“Yes,” Kaire said, slowly. “Much better now.”

“Thisote, you better control yourself. Look what you did to your friend. Is that I have taught you?”

“I’m sorry, Strai. I was just having fun.”

“It was fun at someone else’s harm. That is not acceptable. You must apologize to Kaire right now.”

“It is fine, Strai. I am better now,” Kaire said.

“No, it is not fine,” Strai retorted, her hands crossed under her breasts, just as she used to back then.

“I’m sorry, Kaire. I shouldn’t have done that.” I apologized, controlling a smile. It felt good for Strai to speak so normally, even for a moment.

“It is fine. Truly. It isn’t like I hadn’t done that to myself before,” she laughed. I laughed with her, hands on her shoulder. “The things we come up with when we are desperate.” Her chest dropped with a sigh.

“As I was saying. Once that didn’t work, I had to come up with something. That’s when I met Biodmori. She is one of the few prostitutes of her type and who is at a station enough to serve us. Unfortunately for me, most of her types are lowly prostitutes not fit enough for us.”

“And she has one as big as you?” I asked, incredulous.

“Yes, maybe even bigger. I never really compared.”

“And she is blessed?”

“No, she isn’t. As far as I know. It’s genetics. Although I can’t imagine what would happen if her kind were to be blessed. At that point it would be dangerous even to put it into you. People can barely fit mine, and I can barely fit her. Any bigger could damage you.”

“I’d like to see her.”

“And you shall. It’s not too far fortunately. I can only meet her a few times since she lives so far. But staying at Yona’s place gives me a chance to be with her more often.” That’s when Kaire took that same expression that I got when I thought of Strai, or, annoyingly, when Strai thought of Ayasedi.

Part 3
------

True to Kaire’s word, we reached the place rather quickly. It was much bigger than their counterparts in Athos. Those places, usually terms “house of ill-repute,” was structured such: dingy, hot with bodies, and humid with sweat, always stinking from five streets away with sexual fluids. This was different. This one also smelled five streets away, but with a finer scent, and intoxicating scent. There weren’t many people at this time, and then again it was only midday.

The inside was richly decorated with clothes hanging from the ceiling obstructing the view to a podium which would supposedly display all of the prostitutes in the settlement. It was a clever way to build some suspense. Currently, it was empty. A bar was located deeper into the settlement with a bartender currently cleaning cups and preparing for the coming evening.

“Hye, Kaire! Back after a while?” the matron said, a voluptuous woman with a set of bigger Ranthisian breasts that I had seen so far. “And with friends. Are these the otherworlders?”

“Yes. I am visiting my new, Thisote. She is staying at Yona’s, and I am keeping her company. This is Strai, Thisote’s promised.”

“Very pleased to have you here. The Aidi will be kind to us for offering you, our hospitality. I will call in more girls besides Biodmori.”

She turned to call someone before Kaire interrupted, “Wait, Mria. We shall only need Biodmori for now. I will surely call for someone else, if need be, but Biodmori will be enough for now.”

“Of course, she will be. You can’t deny that. I will call her. You can take the usual room downstairs. She’ll be there in a bit.”

Kaire nodded and started towards the room. The room, as big as a room can get, was almost the size of one in Yona’s mansion. It was normally filled as one would expect such an establishment. There were various tools to insert into oneself. Some stranger equipment, like a whip of all things. Yet the most eye-catching object was the strange bed located in the middle. It was taller than most beds and had two levels. The bottom level was the most normal with a nice fluffy mattress and pillows, but the top level was different. It was had rectangular holds cut regularly across its length. Where there wasn’t a cut, the bed was padded with thick cloth. In its entirety it was about as long as a Ranthisian, and high enough so that the second level was at my stomach.

Strai got situated in a chair to the side while I looked around the room exploring all of the accoutrements. Kaire was explaining the role of some of them when Biodmori came in. And I wasn’t expecting her to be what she was although, in retrospect, I am glad I met her. Biodmori walked on 4 legs. Her lower body resembled a tall and long four-legged creature of pure white color. Her body was extremely muscular, and her legs were incredibly thin but strong. But growing out of the front where the creature’s head would be the upper body of a pale Ranthisian. If looking at only the upper half of her body, one wouldn’t notice a difference. Yet what caught my attention was her cock. Located near the back, underneath her long body, it was situated between the rear two legs, right under a tail which grew from the back. It remained close to her body by a set of straps, yet it was clear that it was large. Not just lengthwise, but in girth as well.

“Kaire! You are back!” Biodmori said in a surprising loud voice. Kaire rushed towards her and embraced her. It should be noted that only Kaire couldn’t done such a thing as because of long legs, she was able to stay at level with Biodmori. “It’s been a long time. I was missing you.”

“And I you,” Kaire replied, kissing Biodmori again.

“Will you introduce me to your friends. They look… different.”

“Yes. This is Thisote and Strai. They come from another world. Athos.”

“Ahh, otherworlders. What a blessing! Have you come here to show them our fine setting and hospitality?”

“Yes, that is my other goal, besides being with you.”

“Shall I call on my friends to join us. I fear I may not be enough alone.”

“Nonsense. You’re not alone. You have me. And besides, Lady Strai will not be joining us. She has hesitancies from her world that has not left her. On the other hand, Thisote is quite taken with our customs, so we must give her much pleasure.”

“We will. And I would like to know all about your world!”

“Of course! But now is not the time! Come!” Kaire grabbed my hand and led me to the lower bunk level. She urged me to lay down on her back while Biodmori maneuvered her long body towards us.

“You haven’t had me inside, have you?”

“Surprisingly, not yet.”

“Well, are you ready?”

“Always.”

“Here we go then,” she said. With the experience of a someone who has had a large member their entire life, she pushed the tip inside me, slowly and confidently. And it was large. And hard.

I could feel her hips brushing up against my legs as she filled me more and more, and yet there was always more. It was like it never stopped. Even Gidi seemed pale in comparison to this. I let a long groan as I pushed at her hips away from my body as my mind tried to reject the rather large unusual foreign object, but she continued. I could hear Strai gasp, and a small gasp of satisfaction from Biodmori as Kaire entered me fully.

“I’m not sure how big you are inside, Thisote, but there seems to be more room. I never thought I would be one to say this, but I don’t think I’m big enough.” Kaire seemed flustered. “But there may be a chance I’ll reach it. You’ll see.”

“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” I said gasping for air as my body acclimated itself to the thing inside of it. “I feel quite full to the brim.”

I closed my eyes as the initial pleasure washed over me. I could feel Kaire twitching inside of me, and I pulled her in an embrace. Her breasts with their hard nipples dug into mine, yet I could feel that the sensation excited her too, as the cock inside me started to shiver uncontrollably. Her his started to gyrate in circles. It wasn’t the powerful thrusts that I was used to, but equally as pleasurable especially with Kaire.

“Sorry to ruin your moment, but if you’re comfortable, I’m going to join in,” Biodmori called. I opened my eyes to see that Biodmori had been situated at the top level. I could see right under her through the valley of her cleavage. And I understood the purpose of the strange design. Biodmori’s penis was perfectly situated to enter Kaire. And it did. And Biodmori didn’t do it slowly like Kaire did for me. She pushed in them like a battering ram, and I could feel the effects inside me. A large moan escaped me and Kaire. To a listener without context, it might have seemed like a moan of pain, but it was much stronger.

Kaire and my voice echoed through out the room and maybe even outside as Biodmori started. The bed creaked as she rapidly thrust into Kaire’s vagina. And Kaire, on the other hand, had no need to exert herself, as the power of blows passed through her into me equally well. The tip seemed to reach beyond the limit to what even Kaire professed she was not capable of. The whole room seemed to shake with each thrust and echoed with the screams of ecstasy.

Even after a considerable time, during which both Kaire and I found our hands exploring each other’s body, I could see that Biodmori had barely broken a sweat. She held a calm demeanor while performing her thrusts, which seemed very mechanical. She seemed to be holding back to the usual love and affection that she would show Kaire during their exploits. It may have been because of her joining in. After all, Kaire was constantly facing me. It wasn’t long when I reached my fifth orgasm.

“I am close,” Kaire said. “I do not have your endurance, Biodmori. I wish to come inside you.”

“Of course, my love,” she said, kissing each other, while Biodmori stroked Kaire. I laid there under the bed, looking at Strai. She smiled back at me hesitantly when she saw me looking. I got up from the bed and walked towards Strai. The two lovers, seeing the opening, moved towards the bed where Kaire proceeded to penetrate Biodmori from the back. It was a strange sight: love at a distance, where Kaire furiously thrust into Biodmori who moaned from the other end of her long body.

I sat beside Strai on the floor. Her eyes quickly fleeted over my young breasts. I changed the position of my feet, shaking them on purpose just to tease her.

“I’m not sure how you find this enjoyable,” she said, shaking her head. Yet her eyes remained fixated on the two paramours in midst of their action. “Those things inside you. They are massive. They probably do more harm than good.”

“For those two, it’s love. For being similar in their plight and position. Yet for me, it’s the freedom that comes with it. Tell me, Strai. In Athos, weren’t you tired of the constraints? Don’t do this, don’t do that. Only wear this here, and that there. Do not talk with him like that. Do not talk with her at all. Don’t stare. Bow your head if they are this, but not if they are this other thing. Complications every where. But not here. Here you can be with whomever you want whenever you want.”

“But this? Freedom should come with some sense of modesty and decorum.”

“Modesty? Decorum? Those are exactly those things that constrain us. Things that constrain you. Look,” I said, standing up. “I go out like this, and no one would say anything. It doesn’t matter if you’re the daughter of the highest queen, or a drunkard. I can go to any noble and ask him to lick my pussy, and they will do so happily.”

“I don’t know.”

“Strai, you won’t know until you try it. Just once, trust me. All you have to do is take off your top and tell me if it doesn’t feel good.”

“Thisote!”

“Just once. Not outside in front of Yona, or any other. It’s just me, and two people lost in love. Come on, everyone here is naked. Everyone is equal here. There is no need to be shy. On the contrary, we should be proud of our bodies.” I could see the hesitation in her eyes, and then a firmness. I had pushed too hard and lost it.

“No. I can’t. I have not stopped you from doing such things, but I will not participate. I am free the way I am.”

I sighed. “Yes, Strai. Your wish.” And we sat there, watching Kaire’s rhythmic pounding. Her eyes had rolled back, and it seemed she was on the edge. “Strai. May I sleep on your lap?”

She stared at me, as if trying to decipher some kind of argument in my statement. Once she was satisfied there wasn’t, she nodded. I laid by head on her lap, staring up at her. Her hands rested on my head almost endearingly.

It was frustrating to not know what she was thinking. Sometimes, she would surprise me by being affectionate, yet at others she clearly seemed to reject my advances. She seemed to be closing up instead of opening, but yet she agreed to marry me, and small gestures such as her smiles and the way she stroked my hair right now. I would rather have this than any number of Ranthisian inside of me. I closed my eyes to the sound of the moaning, as finally Kaire came inside Biodmori. I could hear her panting, while Biodmori shuffle and drop to the ground.

I woke up to find Strai asleep in an awkward sitting position. Her hand had slipped off my head to my breasts. I stayed as still as possible to absorb the feeling of her innocent touch. Biodmori and Kaire slept on their side, facing each other and in an embrace. They were still fast asleep when I came to be.

I remained there, staring, thinking, reflecting. I wasn’t worried about what had happened today. From the time I had arrived, my popularity hadn’t waned. Outsiders were rare here, and I was the only one of two that participated in their events. No matter what happened, I would be invited, and the answers to Riqari’s lies would be given by others who wanted my favor and time, which I didn’t mind giving. On my mind was my marriage with Strai. She had committed, but I had heard so only from Riqari. She had yet to directly tell me of her decision. But then, we hadn’t had time alone to talk the entirety of today. Yet I could sense of the inevitability. I had achieved what I had wanted all of those years ago, and this time Aya wouldn’t come back to stop me. Yet more than being the sole partner of Strai, there was something else that I hadn’t told Strai.

I gazed up at the sleeping Strai through the valley of her breasts. Strai was well endowed, and since that time when we slept together in our small and confined home, I had dreamed of pulling away the clothes from her body. I closed my eyes. I had dreamed of this since then: to just hold her, to feel her every part, explore her body, know every part of it. I wanted to taste her sweet white skin, smell her essence as I slid down her body and hear her voice as she moaned from my tongue. To just pour in happiness from my tongue to her body and see her in utmost pleasure. I wanted our love to be inseparable, not even by abstract, unseeable boundaries, but also by any physical boundaries like clothing. And once our union was complete would I be satisfied.

My body started to tremble from the fantasy which woke up Strai. Of course, the first thing she did was pull away her hand from my chest. I could hear her move, and then soft cloth over my body. I smiled internally and continued sleeping.

--------------

We exited the establishment the next morning and headed back to Yona’s estate in a light, playful mood derived from last night’s event. Unfortunately, that mood was soon subdued by the people we were confronted with at Yona’s place. A large Dragonvolk was situated on the floor talking with the punitive looking Yona. 2 other Beastvolk and a Vahn silently stood behind the talking Dragonvolk. All 5 of them looked at us as we loudly walked in. 2 of Yona’s partners stood to the side taking our thick clothing off and ushering us forward. One led Strai away for some reason. I thought better not to say anything.

“Thisote, come here and meet these fine people. These are the heads of Sassandria’s proud families: Mistress Heiope, Mistress Sanuye, Mistress Airo and Mistress Iensata,” she gestured towards each. I followed Kaire’s example who immediately bowed, seemingly getting lower each time.

“Thisote, why don’t you go upstairs and get cleaned up, while I talk with these fine people.” I nodded and hurried away. I had never heard Yona with such a grave tone of voice.

“This was most definitely about your encounter with Riqari. Those are my mother’s colleagues, members of the Zephyr Council. I’m surprised that Mistress Iensata came herself instead of sending the other members. And she bought so many of the others. This is much bigger than I thought.”

“Well, what do we do?”

“Yona is talking with them. I wish mother had been with them, but I didn’t see her. Yona shall tell you what to say. Don’t say anything that she doesn’t tell you. Until then, we will get cleaned up. You must be your best self amongst these nobles. That is half the battle.”

The servants had set up a warm bath, which we both indulged in. A set of clothes had been laid out for us. They were surprisingly intricate. Mine was a beautiful dress, and like other Ranthisian dresses revealing. But that was where the similarity ended. It was unlike the loose droopy dresses that either Yona or Kaire normally wore, but rather a tight hugging dress. The bottom hem reached only the top of my thigh barely covering my crotch. Two long pieces of cloth flowed from the side like tails. The dress had no sleeves and did not have the iconic deep neckline of the Ranthisian. Rather it covered the entire neck all the way to the top. Instead, an upside tears shaped rip in the dress completely revealed my breasts and extended down to the top of my hips, showing off my stomach.

Kaire gasped as I donned the dress. “Yona has thought this through much more than I anticipated.” She herself had worn a dress of standard Ranthisian cut. Although a usual alteration in her clothes which showed off her well-endowed member was strangely missing. Instead, it was well covered and seemingly made invisible.

“What? Why?”

“Now is not the time to explain. We shall go out and meet the Council first,” she said, before stepping with an unmatched haste. We continued out, Kaire in front, continuously ushering me to be quicker.

The Council members were still outside, but strangely quiet. I moved to towards each of them, kneeling down and kissing the tip of their flaccid penises one by one as instructed by Kaire.

“Sit down, Thisote.” Yona gestured to her side. Kaire moved to my other side, sitting near me, and placing a hand on my thigh for support.

“You look good today, child,” said the Mistress Iensata. I nodded in reply, looking towards Yona for guidance and finding none. “I presume you have figured out why we are here?” She paused, and then continued

“But nevertheless, I must inform you. You have had a recent altercation with Heiope Riqari recently. We are here to understand the matter. Heiope Riqari wishes to pursue a standing of the matter in front of the entire Zephyr Council. We are here to decide if such an action is necessary. Does her side have enough merit to do so? I must hear your words on this matter.”

“Has Yona not spoken on my behalf? I give her the full authority to do so.”

“We must first hear from you and only you before I speak with Yona. So, tell us what exactly happened.”

“Well, there isn’t much to say. As with any of the Family’s event, I was having a fun time with Kaire and Gidi and a few others. Suddenly, Riqari comes and expresses the wish to enter me. Without waiting on my permission, she plunges her member in me. I acquiesce, justifying it to her need. But then Riqari proceeds to end my night by injecting herself in me without asking me. Yet what angered me was that Riqari asked me access to my partner-to-be, Strai, despite being rejected by her directly. She threatened to take my partner without my permission or hers. I got angry, and the rest you have heard.”

There was a surprised look on Yona’s face, which she quickly returned back to normal.

“Is Lady Strai your partner already?”

“No, but such an insult to anyone is a grave insult in my world, and my training does not allow my hands to stay still in such a situation.” There was a tension in the air that was getting overwhelming now.

“Mistress Iensata, may I speak now?”

“Yes, you may now, Mistress Yona,” she said.

“You see all fault of starting the fight lies with Riqari. Thisote only retaliated to an insult, a threat. A disgusting threat at that.”

“But when did Riqari say this? Do you have any proof? Any witness?” Mistress Heiope interjected. There was an edge of anger in her voice, a defensiveness.

“The Goddesses are my witness. I do not lie.”

“Such claims cannot be settled outside the Council on the basis of no witnesses. We must examine the statements and pit the parties together in front of the Council to settle these claims,” Mistress Heiope said, her volume rising as she spoke.

“What Mistress Heiope said is true. If there is any witness to Riqari’s statement, who separately tells us that what you have said is true, then we will not call the Council for this case. But since this is not the case, the Council is needed.”

“There is no need for a Council. Of course, Riqari will deny this allegation, but that does not mean she hasn’t made this afront. The Council should just ignore Riqari’s claim and move to other matters requiring their precious time,” Yona said, getting up. “Regardless of whether the Council wants to pursue this claim, it will have to wait. Lady Strai and Thisote’s wedding is soon approaching, and I will not have it preceded by such a somber occasion.”

“A decision must be reached before the wedding. I will presume that the decision will affect Lady Strai’s decision to continue with the wedding,” interjected Mistress Heiope.

“That will not be the situation, I assure you, Mistress Heiope,” a voice said. Strai approached from the large Dragonvolk doorway in a green and white Athosi *yarti*. “I am sure of my decision to marry Thisote, despite of any decision the Council could make.”

I couldn’t stop looking at her. Her lips were naturally parted after the short statement. Her open hair bounced on her breasts, spilling into her cleavage. The way her skirt swished as she delicately walked towards the sitting Council members. The way her *yarti* top loosely imitated her natural curves, I could feel my muscles tense, and my body yearn for her.

“Lady Strai. You look beautiful. Thank you for giving us an audience,” Mistress Iensata said. “It is an unnecessary question that I must ask you, but are you positive you will want to stay married to Thisote, even if she is convicted?”

“I love her as she loves me, and that love tells me that whatever she did and said was right.” Her voice was resolute and with a confident posture, hands crossed under her breasts.

“I see. Then the matter is done. We have no more business here. The Council will let you know when it will convene for this affair.”

Mistress Iensata and Heiope rushed off, while Mistress Airo and Sanuye stayed. As soon as the other two had left, Mistress Sanuye spoke, “This is all a very bloated affair, according to me. We know what kind of people the Heiope are, and we know all to well how Heiope Riqari is specifically. I don’t think you have much to worry about, Thisote.”

“This affair will not last too long. Unfortunately, you will not be able to attend many of our nightly parties. Of course, those in your support will let you attend, but this week is Heiope’s and the 2 after that are of her close friends,” Mistress Airo said. The Catvolk’s nose twitched as she spoke.

“That is all to well, Mistress Airo,” Kaire interjected. “I don’t think Thisote will want to attend any of those weeks after her marriage.”

Mistress Airo threw back her head in laughter, her braided mane shaking with mirth. “That is all true, Tsami Kaire. You are indeed very luck.”

“When is the wedding, Mistress Yona?” the other Vahn elder asked.

“2 days from now the preparations for the wedding shall be ready. We will perform the wedding unlike either of Thisote or Strai have seen. It will be a full Sassandrian wedding,” Yona said. “A full invitation will be sent to you. But I would like to take the opportunity to welcome you, Mistress Sanuye and Mistress Airo, and your families to the wedding. We would be delighted to have you!”

“Thank you very much! We will surely attend!” Mistress Sanuye left after we completed the formal kneeling and kissing her penis. The Vahn elder didn’t seem to mind when Strai did not participate in the custom.

“As will I, Yona. Before I leave, I would like to offer myself to Lady Strai. Truly, I have not a more exquisite person before, and I would like an opportunity before she becomes Thisote Strai,” the Catvolk elder surprisingly knelt down in front of the clothed Strai. I could see the panic in Strai.

Before she could answer Kaire spoke up, “Unfortunately, it is the custom in Lady Strai’s land to keep themselves clean before their own wedding. Thus, I wish to take the dishonor upon myself by rejecting you in her stead. Please do not be offended by it.”

“I see. Well hopefully I will get to experience one of your bodies after the wedding with your permission, of course, Thisote,” the Catvolk said with a tone of disappointment.

“We would love to, Mistress Airo,” I said, kneeling down and kissing the underside of her cock twice in apology.

“I must retire. Much has happened.” Strai said once Mistress Airo left.

“Lady Strai. I think it is important that you know the process of a Sassandrian wedding. If you don’t mind, I will send Kaire to you to explain the process later,” Yona said. Strai did seem tired. She simply nodded and left, followed by a servant.

“Kaire, I must ask you to stay until the wedding. There is much to be done, and it would be good company to have you with us.

“And Thisote, I congratulate you. Today went well. But you must rest. You have a busy day coming. Spend time with your partner to be. We will meet on the day of the union.”

Part 4
------

The wedding wasn’t at Yona’s house, although the wedding’s location was much smaller. It had already been 3 days since the commencement of the wedding, each day involving different customs and rituals of the Ranthisian. Some involved tedious activities or listening, while some were a little lighter and more fun. Most had been changed because of our differing physiology. I was already exhausted by the today, the 4\ :sup:`th` day. It did not help that since the start of the wedding’s total of 5 days, I hadn’t seen Strai once. Not even a single glimpse. But today was the most important day.

I woke up, ready to move through another set of strange and unknown rituals and events. It was only when I remembered: today was the day when my union with Strai would be finally and completely cemented that my body was filled with energy once again.

Kaire entered my room as I began to get up.

“You’re first today. Let’s get you ready again, shall we?” she said, immediately getting to work dressing me. Kaire, as my best friend, had the important duty as the Lovers’ Dresser. Her duty was to change me and Strai into a new dress after almost every ritual. Neither me, nor Strai could see or touch ourselves or our clothes for the entire 4 days.

Admittedly, I was a little jealous of Kaire. Because of her role, she had been the only Ranthisian, to have touched, or even seen Strai in all her glory. Apparently, it had been terribly difficult to convince Strai of the actual existence of the custom. It had taken Yona, and many of her mates to convince Strai to strip in front of Kaire and only in front of Kaire. She seemed to have gotten more comfortable with Kaire dressing her, as Kaire had come successively early every morning now, quickly dressing Strai before coming to me.

Surprisingly, a Sassandrian wedding was extremely modest in terms of clothing compared to their normal everyday life. The guests wore clothing that usually managed to cover most of their bodies. My and Strai’s clothing were the most suggesting with just an exposed stomach or at most a suggestive cleavage. Apparently, the seamstress was a little bit more liberal to emphasize our otherworldliness.

“So, what’s the plan today?” I asked, as Kaire draped a long piece of cloth over my shoulder.

“I don’t know. I’m doubting whether you will get married today. Strai seemed a little on the edge. I’m thinking she may walk out on you because of our last custom,” Kaire said. She was smoothing out some pieces of the clothing. “Is she really so modest? It’s only you, the person she’s going to marry.”

“It’s how the people in my world were raised. And I don’t think it’s the act that she’s scared of, but something else,” I hesitated. That moment was the moment I had been waiting for so long. I couldn’t believe it was time, and in the most unlikeliest circumstances. “It’s something else that I can’t explain to you. And even if I could, it would take too long. But I trust that she will not quit on me so close to the end. It’s a small hurdle for her, which I know she will overcome.”

“Well, I hope so. At least I know you’re excited. You’re so wet, I’m going to have to change your clothes again,” Kaire said shaking her head and stripping me again. Her cold hands moved quickly as she wiped my crotch with cold cloth that killed my arousal and redid me with different clothes.

“Off you go. Good luck.”

==============

I was still in bed, when Kaire came. She was later than usual, probably helping Thisote first before me.

“Still in bed, I see,” Kaire said as she came in. She wasn’t dressed yet and had walked in with practically no clothes as she was wont to do. I had gotten very used to the nudity, but for some reason the flopping penis in her crotch made me blush today. “If you want, I can come some other time. Today is a little less busy.”

“No, it’s okay, Kaire.” I got up with Kaire’s help and stood as she started dressing me. The past 4 days hadn’t been too tiring in terms of the activities, but by the strangeness of it all. There were many rituals that I had to participate in, most of them modified for our situations. Many had required my parents, which Kaire’s mother had fulfilled. Some required different relatives all of which were arranged in some capacity. There was one that required my last lover, which embarrassingly enough was done by Kaire. Slapping Kaire’s penis 5 times on a large rock obtained from Yona’s house that was colored red 5 times wasn’t the most embarrassing thing I had done, but it was the most strangest. This one had been on a rather large list of things I didn’t want to do or had ever even thought to do. Most were not as strange and even a little understandable. One involved Kaire’s mother, representing my mother, giving me a complete demo of how to be impregnated and how to give the most pleasure to your partner by being submissive. That one was interesting as I had assumed most Ranthisian wouldn’t require that on their wedding, having already been given pleasure or pleasuring someone at least once before their first wedding.

All of these things Kaire had explained to me. But there was one, today that had taken me aback. It forced me to commit the one thing that I wanted to avoid. It was the reason I had agreed for this marriage. The thought had occupied me the day that Kaire had explained to me the 5 days of Sassandrian marriage. The first day was dedicated to rituals to cleanse the couple before marriage. The second day was dedicated to teaching the couple of marriage and what entails. The third day was dedicated to offering the couple to the Goddesses, to deem them acceptable for marriage. The fourth day was the marriage, where an elder would exchange the vows required of the married couple in front of a statue of a Goddess to whom the marriage was dedicated. It could be any Goddess other than Skezna. The Goddess would determine the type of marriage, the type of relationship between the two couple.

What troubled me wasn’t the fact that the main marriage ceremony would be in nude, bared before the Goddesses, but the fact that after the marriage, Thisote as the dominant partner would have to take me in front of everyone. The fact seemed to bring out the farcical nature of this entire marriage. I was doing this to avoid having to reject sleeping with Ranthisians, to keep myself pure as I could for Ayasedi. Yet all I had accomplished was to sleep not just with someone but sleep with them in front of a crowd of 300 or so people. It did not help that the person I was having sex with was Thisote, who I had practically seen growing up from a teenager.

“You’re done, Strai,” Kaire said, stepping back. Odd, I hadn’t even felt her dressing me up. Most other days, I would grow hot from embarrassment from even her slightest touch. “Do you mind if I get dressed here?”

“No, please do. Actually…” I could feel my cheeks going hot from saying it. “Do you want my help? Getting dressed?”

I could see the surprise on her face. She just nodded. I took her clothes from the basket she brought and started to help her long hands and legs through.

“So Kaire. The Last Ritual. How do you think will it go for us? I mean, Thisote and I?”

“Uhhh. I don’t know. Usually, the case is the dominant one in the couple penetrates the submissive [16]_, but I guess there is no penetration – ohhh” Kaire stopped as my hands accidentally brushed against the tip of her crotch. “Sorry, Lady Strai. I think I will dress myself. I think you’re rubbing off on me, and I’m going modest. Or it may be that I’ve been saving myself for the last day, but I’m going to burst if you touch me once again,” she said quickly and then walked away to dress herself.

“What was I saying, uhhh. Yes, there is no penetration happening here, so I guess it’s up to Mistress Iensata what will happen,” she said, coming back. “I’m guessing, either you or Thisote will have to go down and pleasure the other by tongue. By Ranthisian custom, pleasuring by tongue is supposed to be done by the submissive, so you.”

“I see.”

“I feel like the night is going to be long. The ritual has to go on until the dominant one hasn’t achieved an orgasm. And I haven’t actually seen you…” she trailed off, this time her cheeks turning a bright red shade. “I will go away now. I’ll come back when everything is ready.” She hurried off behind.

I groaned inside. How would it feel? Thisote’s vagina in my face. No, on my tongue. I had gone down on Aya many times. It was fun when we had first started exploring each other, having fun, learning. But this would feel entirely strange. More so with the fact that it was with Thisote, rather than with so many people watching, although that would be a first as well. Though I smiled inside at how embarrassed Kaire had been at herself.

What would Ayasedi say to me in this situation? I could only think that if Ayasedi was here, this situation would not be possible at all. She would have found another way. Her amicable personality, her smile at the face of even the worst could capture anyone. She was the perfect being. Modest in her upbringing despite her scandalous profession. Just her beside me would have made all of this so much more bearable.

She had changed little in her time outside. She seemed even a little livelier. Those extra limbs of hers, which were a little strange to see in the beginning, gave her more room to display her lively personality. They seemed to giver an extra window into her besides her eyes.

My thoughts were broken as Kaire called to me from the outside. “Come out, Lady Strai. It is time.”

I breathed a deep breath and stepped out into the otherworld.

==============

It was finally time for the wedding. The audience, a mass of writhing, moving, almost alive crowd, suddenly grew silent as Mistress Iensata started to change the hymns of the Ranthisians. I gazed into the eyes of Strai. I couldn’t see the thoughts behind them. Oh, what I would have given to see the thoughts behind them.

After each line, Mistress Iensata gestured at Kaire who slowly deliberately withdrew a piece of clothing from my body. Once from mine, then once from Strai. I hid my feeling of triumph as slowly my Strai’s body was finally revealed to me. Starting from her beautiful two legs, sculpted to excellence by some divine force, Kaire moved to her arms then her stomach, each more exquisite than the last. Each glowed more brightly in the sunlight than any valuable diamond or emerald.

Her every single shiver urged me to rush to her and grab her body, to share my warmth with her and be as one.

Finally, Kaire pulled apart the cloth that covered Strai’s breasts, and even the crowd elicited a soft admiring gasp at the beauty which was displayed to them. I could see Kaire smile as she saw the cloth on my crotch become wet again from just my imagination. I couldn’t wait. Time seemed to move insufferably slow. I had a singular urge to ignore Mistress Iensata’s chanting and rip apart that last cloth and make love to my Strai. Yet I constrained myself with much difficulty.

I would have so loved to see the sight to behold. The two otherworldly beings in their full nude glory looking at each other in the sunlight, waiting to be joined in a loving union.

And then there was a light, more radiant than any light in the entire wedding. And two beings appeared, suspended above the fire in the middle of me and Strai. And everything and everyone seemed to pause. Mistress Iensata stopped her chanting as even she gazed at the two beings before us. There was one, a Houndvolk, beautiful and soft, clothed in a single, plain, dark cloth that contrasted with her ethereal white skin. Besides her two hands, 4 more sprouted from her back, carrying various objects. Looking at her, I felt a calmness, like one feel gazing out over the horizon on the beach of a calm sea.

The other was the opposite. Even glancing at her made me cower in defeat, to just strip and lay down and submit to whatever the Mistress had me do. It took all my strength to not do so, and yet I knew inside that she had dimmed her aura, and that a puny human such as me was no match for her. Even her glow was harsh, hurting my eyes just to look at her for more than a second. Her hands weren’t empty, but they contained weapons, or at least objects that were much more offensive and warlike.

And as soon as they appeared, their glow grew to an unbearable amount and then disappeared, leaving only two Ranthisian. Their appearance was the same, just without the contrasting aura or radiance. It was a sight to see, as the entire audience of 300 or so people quickly knelt down in subservience to the brilliant show.

“Lady Thisote and Lady Strai. We are terribly sorry for the late appearance, but we thought we might still be welcome before the ending of the marriage ceremony. At least, we will be here for Last Ritual,” said the Vahn goddess. The Houndvolk

I hesitated, stricken by the normality of the conversation. “We are pleased to have you…”

“Mistress Anket, and Mistress Skezna,” the Goddess said. Immediately, Mistress Iensata crossed the podium on her knees to offer the proper respect to the Goddesses with me and even Strai following close behind.

“We are pleased to welcome you, Goddess Anket and Goddess Skezna,” the Dragonvolk elder said, still kneeling. “Would you like to say the last words of the ceremony, Goddess Skezna. The union will be forever blessed if you do so.”

The Houndvolk did not say a word before chanting in the most mesmerizing voice. She finished with a power that struck everyone in their hearts deafeningly, leaving them in a state which one’s ears experience after standing next to a large ringing bell.

“We have so few visitors. There are 9 others who we haven’t had the opportunity to meet, nor see. They are out of our reach in lands that may only be reached by Hizperta. But since you are here, we would like to extend a late welcome to our lands and invite you to enjoy the beauty of its creatures created by our Mother, Pheruksa and her Daughters,” the Houndvolk said.

“Unfortunately, we will not be able to extend our stay to the most glorious day of the wedding. Yet as our apology, I welcome you to ask for a gift. Anything we may provide to make your stay here more enjoyable,” the Goddess Anket said.

I could see Strai speaking out, yet before she could say anything Skezna spoke, “I know, child, what you wish. And I truly lament your position, child. But unfortunately, your wish we are not capable of executing. Yet I will say, your wish will be fulfilled one day, eventually. And it will not come with much more suffering.” Strai grew silent, nodding a faint nod before assuming a position that exuded satisfaction or content. She even seemed less aware of her nudity which had so troubled her before.

Now the attention of both Goddesses turned towards me, and it was my turn to be speechless. Even without their aura, it was difficult to gather courage to ask something of two Goddesses. “I know after what you are receiving today, there is nothing more you could ask for. It is a rather large choice that we have put forward towards you. From all that we have seen, you have enjoyed yourself in the world our Mother made. So, we give you a gift, something to remind you of the new home you’ve made for yourself,” the Goddess Anket said. “We hope that you will accept it and like it.”

Everyone seemed to grow still around me, as from my naked body, right above my vagina, a part grew that I couldn’t deny that I had dreamed of having. It had been dreams of Strai, and me using what this object that both men in my world had, and these Ranthisians had. What I knew would give pleasure to Strai the best conceivable way. The Goddesses smiled at me when it fully grew out, large and grand. Almost as long as the member of Kaire’s, and thicker.

“We designed it to your liking, yet if you should change it, it will obey your command, with or without our presence,” said Anket. “Believe it or not, I’m proud of you. The dominance you have shown, the initiative to change. You are a strong being, though not my sister as another creation of Pheruksa and Her Daughters. I am honored to make you my sister by giving you this physiology similar to that of my sisters. Enjoy your union.”

I said nothing. I couldn’t think. It had all happened so fast. And just like that, they were gone. Everyone resumed their original speed, and there stood Strai, ready.

==============

Was I ready? I remembered what the Goddess had said to me before she left. I would meet Ayasedi, if not now, then tomorrow or the day after or the month after, or the year or ten years. But I would see her, and we would be together.

So then is this union not faithless? Knowing that I would get to be with my love yet still participating in this farce of a marriage. And even if the marriage was farce, the act that Thisote and I would commit in front of these many witnesses would be real.

The new Thisote, unfazed by the change, this “gift” that she received, advanced towards me, softly taking my hands and moving me towards the stone bed setup near the dais. The cold seemed to suddenly catch up to me as my naked butt touched the stone.

Thisote reached out for a reassuring kiss, a show, a farce. I kept telling myself. I participated. Involuntarily, but I participated.

I thought, I could end it right now. Even with the visit from the deities and all the occasion, I could end it now. But then where would that leave me. Even more open to suggestions and force. Even more chance to be faithless to Ayasedi. Time seemed to slow down as Thisote’s member rose as if by command. My mind raced through the implication of what I would be going through.

But then I had my answer. Faithlessness was a choice. Ayasedi’s occupation to satisfy her clients, it wasn’t a choice, but was forced. My forced union with my husband, a compulsion by society. It hadn’t been faithless, what Ayasedi had done with whatever clients she had had, because each moment she had done so, she thought only of me. And I could attest to that, since each moment my husband had forced me to his bed, I had only prayed that this torture would end with me and Ayasedi’s arms. And that comforted me. For my union with Thisote was justified. It was not a choice, but a necessity, a compulsion by situation.

With that I finally laid back, a smile on my face, my cold body exposed to this otherworld and its people, my legs open to the incoming Thisote and her new body.

Discovery
=========

I squirmed as I felt two fingers push inside of me, eliciting even more laughter from my torturers. I knew by now struggling wasn’t an option. I’d learned that long ago, but instinct still took over.

Today, they had me in a different position, hands crossed over under my breasts, tied on the opposite side. Apparently, it was to give me a different position, to make me comfortable, but I knew. It was by popular request to show more of my cleavage.

The two fingers moved about, exploring some crevice inside me which even I did not know about. More hands joined in exploring some other part of my body, feeling, groping, sometimes pinching, sometimes grabbing. My eyes rolled about searching for the source of those hands in an artificial darkness created by a blindfold. My nose was overwhelmed by a perfumed environment that overcame any other scent from reaching me. Echoing conversations filled the entire room which I was located in, making it hard to pin down any one voice. My entire world at the moment was those hands touching my body and the laughter elicited by my squirms. It was an experience that my few months at the Academy Courtesan hadn’t prepared me for.

The two fingers left, immediately replaced by two more. It was the same, moving about, wriggling inside me, looking for who knows what. I could tell these were bigger, covered with soft hair, and tipped with claws, trimmed but still deadly. They moved about dangerously before 3 of their sisters joined them. I groaned as the larger mass moved inside me. The creature with their hands me seemed to be reaching higher, yet something stopped them. Whatever it was, I was grateful to it, living or not.

A yelp escaped me, as the hands pinched inside me. I could feel the claws ripping through skin in the pinch spilling blood. Yet, the creature wasn’t done. It scooped at the wound, opening it wider, before violently pulling out their hands. The two successive actions gave way to a scream and more thrashing which elicited an applause and more laughter. More blood flowed out of the wound, dripping down my vagina, traveling down my thighs, pooling who knows where.

Between the laughter and applause, I could hear a growling voice that could only belong to the one who had pierced me. “Interesting. Red blood. And it tastes different. Delicious.”

I could only hope in that instant that the monster did not return for seconds, and my wish was fulfilled as a smaller hand entered me, moving about with much more fervor than before. I could hear a voice much closer to me say, “Don’t go to deep, child, your hands might be dirtier. Oh dear, so much blood. Is there any water around here?”

The hand left, followed by the sound of splashing of water. The hands outside continued to explore me, moving, scratching, pinching. New hands constantly entered and left. I could feel my blood thickening, yet it was still smeared across my thighs and crotch, as people carelessly moved through it without concern for dirtying their hands like that one child. At one point, I felt cold liquid being poured onto my breasts. Whatever it was, it dried into some sticky substance which pulled at my skin as hands left my body.

Such was my world for who knows how much time. My hands grew sore from the position I was forced to maintain. Eventually, the hands stopped, the laughter slowly died down, until I was alone, and I could only the hear the groans and growls of my companions. After the few moments of peace, I felt a rush of icy water over my body, and two more furry hands, strong and rough, rubbing my down furiously. They moved through my entire body, first my face, then arms, breasts, and stomach. They took a little bit more time around my thighs before eventually cleaning out my vagina. The pain that had dulled returned as the hands carelessly swept over the wound.

Once my body was cleaned, they removed my bonds. Unfortunately, my legs immediately gave way, and I immediately fell down an arms length to hard floor. I hastily removed the blindfold, yet had to close my eyes as light flooded in.

“Come, quickly now. You’re the last one, and we need to take the place down,” a rough voice said.

My legs did not cooperate with me and gave way beneath me. I knew the process now. A warning slap sounded on the ground. I tried my best to avoid what was to come, but it was useless. A resounding slap echoed, and a stinging pain emanated from by back through my whole body. Instead of helping me from the ground, I was put back with more force. The overseer plunged me into pain twice or thrice more before realizing it was of no use. She pulled me up with rough hands landing me on my wobbly feet and push me forward, albeit with a little less force. I reluctantly moved forward, walking through cages of animals and plants I had never seen before. Other performers and attendants were putting up the tools of the trade. I wondered what it would be like being a performer instead. I’d heard them complain. It wasn’t their life was easy. But at least it wasn’t being a mere attraction, an animal to look at and touch as you please.

I walked around the large, brightly lit room that had been provided to the menagerie. Already several types of Ranthisian had started to put away different exhibits.

The whip once again cracked on my naked butt propelling me forward. “Walk faster, my little toy,” the overseer said. “I have other things to do than escort you around like a princess.”

I pulled my head down and started walking faster. I was escorted out the large room into open, where the overseer led me into a barn, which was a glorified name for a fenced in area with a minimal canvas roof. The pen was occupied by only 2 other people right now but chains for different assortments of animals that I had seen caged in the previous room were laid out on pegs or fence. The more dangerous kind would be kept in their cages. At least that wasn’t for us.

The overseer threw me onto the dirty, feces layered floor before, for good measure, throwing a slap across the side of my waist.

The two figures walked towards me into the light. Both pulled me up gently and helped me to a cleaner spot on the floor.

“You’re bleeding. Was it the overseer?” Erata asked. She looked around for a cloth but finding none she settled with cleaning the blood dripping from my vagina.

“What if it was? You wouldn’t be able to do anything,” I said from the pain. I could feel the welts made on my back and waist from the whip. It hurt to sit on my bottom, so I slid down on my stomach for some relief.

“There, there. Don’t speak. Let her rest, Erata. Today hasn’t been so good for her.”

Mother looked around her desperately. Finding nothing that could help me, she nodded in disappointment and got up after Saetha. “We’re here. Sleep.”

I stared at them as they slowly walked away from me, whispering amongst themselves. Both of them, Saetha and Mother, they looked so poised, so different. Even in their state, Saetha stood tall like the princess she was born. Erata, although a prostitute as she was, had been a powerful one before she’d aged. A *Veshya* could control states and countries with a point of her finger. And yet the two women just stood there doing nothing.

I still remembered the conversation I had with Mother on the matter.

*“Mother why? If you don’t want to, then I will. I was sent to train for it, and even if my training isn’t finished, just by sleeping with the woman, he could at least provide us with a bed, better food, better conditions. We could negotiate,” I pleaded.*

*“No. Since Ayasedi convinced us to come with her, I thought we could change our lives. I was forced into the entire affair, and so were you. But not many people get the chance we’ve gotten: to start over, to begin anew as different people. Why would you want to go back?”*

*“And how is our situation any better than what it had been?” I could feel myself shaking from frustration. “At least we can use the skills, no matter how degenerating those skills are, to better our position now, then to yearn for a life that could be. What are the chances that these people will let our lives improve? They will push us, to our extremes. For now, we’re only attractions to look at, to admire, to touch. Soon, we may be handed to people as livestock, to use as they will. How is that any better than what I propose now?”*

*“You don’t know that. People will tire of us, and then these people will have no other chance than to either let us go or make us do something else.”*

*“And what then? Will those conditions be any better?”*

*“I don’t know. But what I do know is that neither you, nor me, nor Saetha is doing any favors for anyone, and that’s that.”*

I’d stomped away that day, and in my anger kicked the overseer. That day I had received my first lashing. Erata had been more disappointed at me than concerned. “That’s what you get for your anger,” is what she’d said. It wasn’t like I hadn’t received lashings for my anger after that. After that, I was simply at the mercy of the overseer.

The welts still burned, but the cool air helped with easing some of the pain so that soon I’d fell asleep in the hard floor.

Next, I awoke, all the animals had been chained up beside me. One, a large iridescent feathered creature with four legs, large, folded wings, and a large flat beak, hopped up towards me and started licking my back with its tongue. I lay there for a while, welcoming the soft, warm touch of the bird, relaxing in the little warmth the land provided. Only when the tongue got uncomfortable close to my crotch that I got up. The bird, I’d named it Uru, pulled back calmly, demanding a scratch on the head for its services. After giving Uru her requisite scratches, I looked around in search of Saetha and Erata, but couldn’t spot them.

I shivered as a sudden chilly wind brushed past me. The sun had risen, yet it provided no heat, and the land was still covered in rolling fog. I was surprised I was allowed to sleep this late. Instead of being woken up Uru’s soft tongue, I would be woken by either hot, scalding, or icy, freezing water thrown at me, whatever the overseer could find. Usually, the Mother and Saetha slept beside me, and I would find at least one of them, but this time I woke alone. Moreover, I was surprised to not find either of the two adults upon walking around the entire pen. Usually, we weren’t allowed to leave the pen, just as the animals in the pen weren’t.

I saw my overseer standing to the side, playing with the edge of her shirt, cozy in her warm clothes. The woman, as I called everyone in this strange land, because every person I met had the hint of a bosom under the warm, layered, clothes and the voice quality close to that of an Athosi woman, was not human. Her face was that of a black four-legged carnivore [17]_ found on Athos and I presume also found on Ranthis. Other than her face, her hand was covered in the same black fur that covered her face and tipped with claws sharper than the ones I had felt yesterday. There were no other differences that I could see outside of those. So, hoping her mood had changed after a night’s sleep, I trudged along to the side and, from a safe distance, asked in broken Ranthisian, “Where my parents?”

The overseer looked at me curiously. “They’re at master’s tents. He wanted to inspect his goods. They will be back before the full sun,” she said flatly. It took a few seconds to process what the woman (because I presumed to call everyone a woman in the strange world) had said. And then, instead of retreating I stood there, thinking. What could go wrong? Mother wouldn’t know, she wasn’t here. And if I was successful, we could at least get some luxury for the traveling that was coming up.

“What’s the matter?” the overseer said looking at me. I could see her hands reaching for the whip on her side.

My mind raced quickly at my next step, and I lunged at the overseer’s feet. “Please! Cold! Hit! No!”

The overseer stopped. I got up slowly, getting closer to the overseer as sensually as I could.

“I cold. Very,” I said, before hugging the woman, my hands innocently cradling her breast. “You cold. I make warm.”

“You are a strange creature,” she said, looking curiously. Her hand grabbed at my face roughly, the claws digging into my skin. I winced in pain to which she threw back her head in laughter. “I have had a Vahn in my life, but nothing like you. Come out.”

She let go of me and opened the door of the pen, motioning me to walk out. For a minute, she just stood there staring at me like she had never seen me. The woman walked towards me, putting her hand in my crotch, and feeling me, her warm furry hands softly rubbing my crotch. Her muzzle reached for towards my neck, for what I thought was a kiss. Instead, her tongue went for a long ride up my neck to my mouth, where it entered and swept the inside in what I thought was the Ranthisian kiss. Not knowing what to do, I pulled into the embrace and played around with the tongue inside me.

I shivered in the cold as the woman pulled out and tasted my entire neck and face, all the while fingering my anus, while the other grabbed at my ass.

“You are truly cold,” the overseer said. “Come. We cannot go to my carriage, but I know of a warm place which is also empty.”

She led me to the room from last night, but not to where I previously was. It seemed the overseer was also excited, as when we got to where no one could see us, she grabbed me into her arms and raced off with a surprising speed. We came upon a small room hidden in the back where I could see few people. The room, an almost empty storeroom filled with a few bags of broken lamps, some bags of rolled up canvas and straw each, and some wooden boards with nails affixed to them lying about.

The almost-human woman threw me onto one such bag of canvas and emptied a bag of straw beside me and quickly created a comfortable looking bed with the straw and canvas. She picked me up with the same quickness and put me on the makeshift bed.

“Help me out of my clothes, my vixen,” the overseer said, grinning her animalistic grins. I gently pulled away her clothes, starting from the top, all the while kissing her muzzle. Her hands, not having explored my ass enough, roamed around there, reaching around elsewhere as they wished, yet avoiding the scarred back that she herself had caused. I tried much not to think on that.

Soon enough, I had rid her of her jacket and shirts to reveal thick, supple, and strangely firm breasts. I attacked the dark-skinned breasts with my tongue, expecting to feel the aroused nipples in an instant in the wintry weather. Again, did the strange, unfamiliar environment surprise me. In trying to arouse the woman, I forgot about the pants, which the overseer was not happy about.

“Come, woman, enough wasting about,” she said in annoyance. Her rough hands pulled me away from her breasts, and a surprising slap threw me onto the floor, and painfully on my back.

The woman pulled down her pants to reveal my last surprise of the world that I had been living in for the last 2 months. Instead of pussy, which I would expect any woman to have, stood a rather large, partly furry penis at attention. Seeing this did my confidence falter a little.

Most of my confidence in seducing the overseer came from the fact that my training in the *Academy Courtesan* as a Trainee was focused on seducing and having sex with a woman. As a new Accepted, I had little education or talent with the sexual organs of the opposite gender. The little I had received was to the extent of hold the penis and starting to seduce it with my tongue. Which is what I did.

I edged towards the rather large member, staring at my adversary. The member was strange, nothing like the human cock I had seen in a demonstration at the *Academy*. The skin did not cover the head like the human’s cock. Rather it stopped at the head, which was covered with small white spikes. The skin itself was covered with black fur which slowly faded away as it reached the head. I looked at the head and then the overseer. She nodded with encouragement, and so I went for it.

The overseer made a strange, womanly purr as my tongue touched the tip [18]_. I timidly circled the pink head with my tongue for a moment before slowly sliding the head into my mouth. But like before, the overseer wasn’t satisfied with the slow pace at which I went. She took my head and pushed the entire thing down my throat. This time an even louder purr escaped the overseer.

The overseer did not give me back control, instead she used her hands to violently guide my head to her pleasure. Instead of thrusting her hips back and forth into my head, she moved my head back and forth into her cock. My eyes rolled back as my breathing decreased. The speed with which the overseer made me pleasure her gave my body no time to decide when to breathe. The second my airways seemed to be able to let air pass through, the other it was blocked. I felt myself ready to go unconscious. My eyes rolled back, and hands, previously on the woman’s thighs, dropped to my limp from a lack of oxygen [19]_.

Just as my vision started to fade to black did the overseer let go of her iron grip, throwing me with such force into the makeshift bed. I gasped for air, but my throat burned with the damage of strange spikes which I had underestimated.

“That should have made your throat sufficiently warm,” the overseer said with a growl. The hungry expression on her face made me shiver. It was quite the opposite of the laughing, encouraging expression she had before. “Now, it is your little pussy’s turn.”

My heart thumped, partly from fear, partly from the horrifying anticipation, and partly from the acceptance of my fate. The woman was nowhere near as delicate as the first time my teacher had inserted the dildo in me. For one, that one was a much smaller, much more artificial affair, whose surface stuck to the skin without some lube or spit. The overseer’s live member was much larger, it’s diameter at least than 3 fingers across, and at least a hand and a half in length [20]_. Moreover, the member was thrust into me with no mercy whatsoever.

The overseer’s purr of pleasure was drowned by my gasp from the inhuman cock suddenly occupying me. The cock stayed in me for what seemed like a second of relief, as the overseer purred in enjoyment at the feeling of my inside. She licked my burning neck in excitement. Yet that relief was soon followed by a scream as the feline cock pulled back and the small spikes scrapped the walls of my vagina, not only opening the old wound that had barely closed over the night but opening new multiple ones. The half-feline once again plunged her cock in without wait, but this time there was not relief as she slowly began thrusting inside out.

In hindsight, I would have admired her technique, the swaying of hips, the perfect slap achieved by every thrust, the fact that the cock constantly swayed around the inside, reaching every part of the vaginal walls. None of those crossed my minds, as the one advice given to us during the prostitute school: move around, don’t thrust, circle, be able to reach every spot inside her, was the bane of my life in those moments, as every spot the head reached, new wounds opened, and more blood gushed out. All the art in sex was pulled out of me, and every second became just pure torture.

The black fur on her penis was now coated with blood, yet there was so much that each thrust pulled some more out. The blood had started to pool around my thighs.

Sometime in between, she grew tired of the position, and turned me onto my stomach. Unfortunately, I didn’t have enough energy to keep myself upright on my legs and hands, and thus constantly fell down. The overseer did not mind, and her spiked cock continued to ravage me, hurting not just the inside, but the opening wall as well. The spikes not just scraped away the inner skin, but now pierced into the wall, as the wall was pinched between the head and the hard ground below.

The situation worsened as, in the moment, the cat growled and gave me a slap on my butt. The surprising stimulation caused me to tighten around the cock which not only caused me more pain but seemed to give me ravager intense pleasure. Thus, the overseer found another way to make the experience even more painful on my part.

There was no natural light in the room, being lit only by a lantern that gave off a yellow light straight into my eyes. So, my concept of time was quite skewed, and I had no idea how much time passed. Once the overseer was tired of the stomach position, she picked me up and thrust my small body in and out of the cock. As it took too much energy, she leaned me against the wall, my legs hanging limp from her arms, which held my hips. There she pleasured herself.

Once she got tired of that did she resume the first position in which we first engaged in the act. She had entered into some kind of frenzy. Her hips did not pause once except to change positions. Her tongue hung out of her muzzle, limp. Drool dripped out of her mouth, coating my stomach. It was disgusting, yet I had no energy in remedying the situation. Occasionally, she would engage in a kiss that would involve the long tongue exploring my mouth, salivating in it as well. Sometimes she would shift her focus to my breasts, whose bouncing she seemed to enjoy. Unfortunately, she also increased her speed and power of her thrusts to get a greater effect on those pillows.

The frenzy only ended when she finished; inside of me. A final thrust deep inside me spewing a mass amount of liquid that I hadn’t imagined would exist in that small sack hanging under the spiked cock.

My only thought was, “she was done! Finally!” The torture, the one-sided pleasure had ended. And the product was a worn overseer and a mangled Sethi. Blood flowed mixed with the strange purplish semen from my abused orifice, from a thousand gashes that adorned its walls. A single cough itself generated more amount of blood. The little consciousness I had in me, urged me to lay on my side to prevent me from choking on my own blood. The frenzy that the overseer had entered had now disappeared as suddenly as it had come.

“My sweet little toy,” she said, cuddling up to me. Her flaccid yet still large cock, coated with my red blood painted my thighs unknowingly. The overseer rested her muzzle on my throat, her long tongue, which had been furiously licking my breasts, almost pulling the skin itself off them, now delicately licking the same breasts with astonish care. The claws, whose scratches had reopened the scars on my back now cautiously nursed the opening of my vagina. “You don’t know after how long I’ve had this pleasure. I must say. I had mistaken you for a mute, dumb, beast useful only as an attraction. But you do have the one quality that intelligent beings have: sympathy.”

She let out a long sigh of relief. The feline moved her paws up fiddling with my flat, flopping breasts. Besides not having the energy to move, each movement also caused immense pain, and thus I decided to stay still, my eyes staring at the ceiling. Not content with the silence, the overseer continued, “and you have courage as well, aplenty. Not everyone is capable of asking out a Catvolk and then lasting so long. You did admirably. And your body!” She pulled her head up and looked into my eyes as I looked into hers. Her voice lowered to a deep whisper. “It is the most exquisite body I’ve seen in ages, unlike any Vahn, Catvolk, Houndvolk, or others that I’ve had. And…” – with some hesitation – “I’m sorry for what I’ve done. Our… My frenzy after having been invited to a bed after so long was uncontrollable. I did not realize, from another world as you are, you may not have had the experience of a body such as mine. And over that… all the things I had done to you before.” The eyes of the feline expanded, and actually teared.

Even after so horrible an experience, I felt better.

With an effort, I croaked a “thank you.”

The woman smiled a toothy grin, her eyes still filled with sadness and sympathy.

“Allow me to give you some respite, my dear little toy,” she said, smiling. She bent on top of me, kissing the same kiss, but gentler. Her tongue reached inside me, farther than before, into my throat, licking the wounds that had formed. I could feel the thick saliva coat the gashes. It felt odd, strange, but I had not any energy to stop here. But more than that, it actually felt good. Once she was satisfied with the kiss, which was more intimate and refreshing than any of the previous ones I’d been forced to share, she bent towards my ravaged orifice, rendering the same treatment.

This funnily enough, she enjoyed with the same degree I had. Such was the pleasure she derived from this, that her tongue reached so far in, even her wet muzzle and nose slightly entered my vagina. I gasped a little at the stretch of my hole, between the soft giggling as she licked the blood off the inside of the walls.

She moved similarly on the outside, completely covering my body with her soft, endearing licks before going back once again to my vagina. She placed her attention there a moment before she was finally satisfied.

And I felt good. My body felt refreshed, washed, and clean besides some black fur. And I could move.

My fingers traced the long flowing hair of the feline fur that covered her back. When she was done with her service, she came back to me and said, “here, Drink my milk. It will help, give you some energy. You have not eaten all day.”

She lay beside me on her side such that her breasts were level with my head. I embraced her, while suckling on the firm mammary. All the while she ran her claws through my hair gingerly. Her milk, a sweet, thick liquid, stick as it ran through my throat, did not take much coaxing to pour into my mouth, and was truly rejuvenating.

I thus emptied her, first from the left breast and then right. And then we remained in that position, she again continuing in her favored pastime of playing with my breasts.

It was only when a large bell sounded, indicating the moving of the caravan did we get up. The overseer, realizing how much time we had spent, hurried me along. She washed me first with fresh, icy water that she’d found and then carried me off till the entrance of the great, now empty room, and then led me once the area was a little populated. The overseer walked me to the carriage.

“My little toy, thank you for the morning. As much as I would like to go again tomorrow, I see you have yet to get accustomed to a Catvolk such as I,” she said, giving me an endearing lick only after looking around carefully. “Will your companions give you any trouble.”

“Parents? No. But please! No tell!”

“They are your parents? I see. I do not see how they can produce you. Neither of them have our excellent tool. But I have heard of a time, in ancient history or maybe fantasy, that people like you could mate amongst themselves and give birth to children. Anyway, I will provide a blanket and water for the journey. I will be back.”

I entered once the overseer had left. The two women sat inside, shivering from the chilly air coming in through the open window. Both had a look of helpless concern as they searched outside. Both looked up as I entered.

“Where were you?” Erata cried, moving towards me into an embrace.

I evaded her, shrugging her off. “It was some sort of special attraction requested by some children. The overseer took me away this morning. I could ask the same of you. Both of you left without saying a word. You didn’t even bother waking me,” I croaked. The words still took effort to say. Each word, the wounds seemed to scrape together yielding pain that multiplied.

“We didn’t get a chance to. What happened to your voice? Are you hurt?” Saetha said, making a place for me by her side.

I positioned myself beside her, her skin cold to touch. She seemed a lot more comfortable naked now. I remembered the first week when she refused to move out of a specific spot unless absolutely necessary. Her hands had strained to cover her private parts as well as her impressive breasts. Mother and I, while as scared and as shy at first, got over that period quickly as we got accustomed to our place as entertainment animals. *The prostitute and her daughter broke before the princess. As expected,* I thought.

I didn’t answer, but just sat there, hugging Saetha for comfort. Mother detecting my bitterness stayed at her place near the entrance of the carriage.

The cold didn’t take long to catch up to me again. I curled up against Saetha, closing my eyes and embracing the other body.

The overseer soon opened the carriage door, bringing a new onslaught of terrible, freezing wind, but also relief. “Here’s some water,” she growled, throwing a leather flash. “And a blanket. For when it gets cold.”

Both Erata and Saetha looked incredulously as the overseer closed the door behind her. The carriage started soon after.

I reached for the water, but my hand was tossed away by Mother. “We don’t know what she did to that. I don’t trust that creature.”

“Well, I’m not going to die of thirst, Mother. And neither will I let Saetha. Whatever she did to the water, which is probably nothing, it’s at least better than our position right now,” I said, snatching the bottle and blanket with it. “You can freeze to death for all I care.”

I pulled the single blanket over me and Saetha, who had no reaction on her face. Her eyes just blankly stared at me and then she closed them. I followed her example, nestling myself into her arms under the blanket. It felt a little strange now, dirty to curl up so close to so pure a woman after my time with the overseer. I became conscious with every single point where I touched Saetha. My hand on her stomach. My breast lying on hers which was also jammed her my armpit. My legs stretching over her crotch.

Struggling with the dirty feeling, I found my eyes on Erata. Mother, as stubborn as me, had settled on the opposite side, refusing to seek refuge from the cold or thirst. She rested herself against the wall, curled up in a fetal position, arms around stomach, legs closed up, yet her breasts somehow getting clear of their protectors and bouncing violently due to the carriage. I felt sorry for her, yet my ego and rage against her yet kept me from inviting her to both mine and Saetha’s warmth.

With these thoughts, I slowly drifted to sleep, despite the bouncing ride.

--------------

I bolted awake suddenly seemingly without reason. We were still in the carriage, a glorified closed cart. I could feel a nail protruding from the wood poking my back which I hadn’t noticed during my sleep. I shifted, a sudden new pain rising as my nerves caught on with the nail’s travesty.

Saetha was already awake, staring outside the window. There was no sign of mother in her old spot. The atmosphere was less chilly now, yet still cold in its own right. I watched Saetha who was beautifully staring out the window, sad yet calm. The entire scene was reminiscent of a painting I had once seen adorning the office of the head mistress of the *Academy*. The foreign sun’s rays gleamed off the pure white skin of the former princess. Her front faced me as the princess herself looked towards the side, out the window, without noticing that I had woken. Her legs bent in the delicate angle that all proper women in Athos had employed to hide their private property. She stroked her wavy, red hair, which had so uniquely identified her even in Athos, and which fell down her shoulder into the cleft formed by those fleshy mountains of her. Though slightly smaller than Mother’s, they were nevertheless quite impressive in their own right as they heaved up and down in the crisp air. I remembered in Athos, even the women talked of the beauty and power the woman in front of me exuded. That power had not faded, but only retreated to come back at a more appropriate time. I made my awakening known to Saetha once I had finished admiring her.

“Where is Mother?” I asked, brushing my strewn hair down to be more manageable.

“She’s been moved to the cage,” the princess said, turning back to the window. All was quiet for a minute as I tightly wrapped the blanket around me.

“Water?” I asked after getting a swig of it myself.

“No, it’s fine.” That’s it. The terse reply was all I got of the soft voice with its delicate intonation. Again, the silence continued until I could not bear it.

“You have something to say. But you aren’t saying it,” I said. “Is it concerning what I said earlier?”

She stayed quiet, her face giving me a hint of thought, as if she was trying to place words to her feelings yet couldn’t. The door to the carriage opened to reveal the face of the overseer.

“We have stopped for the day. Our true destination is still far, but we have stopped for an impromptu show. We have no need for all 3 of you. The one outside will suffice,” the overseer said, examining the scene inside the carriage. “Here. Some clothes for you and your companion when she comes back. You can walk outside only in the menagerie. You aren’t allowed to relieve your companion or release her, but you may observe your normal workplace. Don’t go out of the premises, or you will not like the consequence.” With that, the overseer slammed the carriage door close, but did not lock it as customary.

The clothes she had given us, thin cloth with countless holes in the local Ranthisian cut I had seen sometimes. It consisted of a long skirt, and a top with sleeves covering the back arm and hem that reached the knees with an open side seam creating a front and back flap. The neckline, a worn affair in the garments given to us, is customarily wide but not deep, and adorned with a simple shawl. And that is what we got.

Saetha moved towards the clothes as the overseer left, staring at them incredulously. “Tell me the truth. Where were you, actually?”

I could see in her eyes the firm belief that I had lied, but stubborn as I was, I delayed the truth. “Let’s wear the clothes first, shall we?”

“No,” her voice was flat and tinged with a little anger now. This I had never heard in Saetha. “What happened?”

“I implemented what I advocated, Saetha. Nothing more. It was my choice to do so, and I acted by my choice,” I said as firm as I could be.

“But why lie about it?”

“Because Mother would have been angry. Why she obtained the knowledge of manipulating people, using her body to influence them, get her way, but when the chance came, she refuses to use it to her advantage. We’re at the lowest point possible as a family. I have no idea where Sister Ashadha or Sister Teshi is, Mother just submits to these people instead of trying to gain some advantage and search for them. It’s been 2 months since we’ve been stuck here. If what I have done today, she had done, with probably more success than I, in the third week, we would have been out of this cage and in some Ranthisian lord’s private carriage who would be commanding his men to search for Ayasedi, Saisheta, or my sisters and cousins.

“I do not regret what I have done, and I will continue to use my body as I wish to gain whatever advantage we can get in this new world. Not you, nor Erata can stop me from it.” And thus, I ended my speech said in a single breath after which I heaved a long sigh to recompense.

And a surprising “very well” is all I got as a response. Saetha offered no arguments, no scolding, no disappointment.

“Come here, child,” she said, opening her arms to an embrace. Those words, the embrace itself brought out the water in my eyes. “You have not seen what we have seen. I was brought down, from a princess living her life in the utmost pleasure, whatever she wanted brought to her feet by loving brothers and a host of servants, to being a toy to a warrior who killed my parents and brothers with her own hand. Erata, she has seen much worse. She never got the chance to a decent life as I had. She was always taught that she was the lowest of the low, despite being around the highest, noblest people. And she never had a choice. Now, in a new world, on a clean slate, she does, and all she wishes is for her daughter to not return to that cycle.”

I opened my mouth to speak, but a glare from Saetha stopped me. She wasn’t finished.

“What she doesn’t understand is, that you do have a choice. What you are doing is not from the present situation, but a certain ambition inside of you that even you probably don’t know of. But I can see it in you.”

“I understand. The overseer, what she did to me I can’t recount. But I would do it again. I don’t care,” I said, placing my head on the woman’s breast, tear flowing down my face onto them. “But how do I explain this to Mother?”

“You don’t. Do what you do best. I will talk to her when the time is right.”

We remained in the delicate embrace until my tears subsided and the determination which I felt when orating my speech came back to me. “Now what?” I asked, getting up.

“Now, we enjoy the little freedom you have obtained us,” she said with a smile. I returned it, forcefully changing my countenance just as she had.

We exited the carriage after getting dressed, finally without the overseer to escort us anywhere. Hand in hand, we continued through the line of carriages, for the first time seeing in clarity the land which had been our home for the last 2 months. We saw strange sights: two-legged Ranthisians with heads of different animals, similar to the overseer. But then there were also Ranthisians with the lower body of animals and upper body of humans.

There was one such group, an assembly of young, well-dressed Ranthisians with lower bodies of a horse who were loudly laughing in front of us. One saw me and tripped. I smiled at the bumbling kid. The Ranthisian grinned and threw me a wink. I did one better, sending an imaginary kiss in her direction.

With a grin to the woman at my side, I said, “I will be a little late tonight.

Lost
====

Our wedding, a small affair composed a few members, Saisheta and Dea from my side, and Craeta’s family, including her husband and sister-wives [21]_, was going quite well. The 5 days of a traditional Ranthisian marriage was shortened to just 2, the first and the fourth day. The first day was used to complete the same tasks of the first 3 days, while the fourth would be for the marriage, and since there weren’t as many people as required, the fifth day’s sexual celebration would be skipped.

The first day had successfully passed, and today was to be my last day in Mother’s house. I took a last look at the small room in our apartment. With its few decorations and foreign architecture, it was unlike anything that a Ranthisian would have felt comfortable in, yet it reminded me of our previous home. I could hear Dea’s soft breathing to my side. The girl could fall asleep anywhere, at anytime. I had been trained to do the same. Saisheta had been insistent that we could sleep at anytime, any place possible. She had drilled into us multiple breathing exercises to make that possible, to give us a light sleep and keep us alert.

Yet all those failed a day before such a big event. I shifted in the bed, which instantly awoke my sister.

“You aren’t asleep, yet? You have to wake up quickly tomorrow,” she said, her eyes drooping from being woken. “And Mother will probably want you ready before the sun is even up.”

“I can’t sleep.”

“That’s not possible,” the girl said, getting up, resting her back to the headboard, mirroring my position. “What is it?”

“I just can’t sleep.”

“It *is* a big day tomorrow. But that’s not reason enough to trouble you so.”

“You know what. We’ve been to a Ranthisian wedding before.”

“Oh… That…” Dea’s cheeks flushed red. “What’s the matter? Don’t tell me you haven’t… with Craeta?”

“It’s not that. But in front of Mother? And you?” I could feel my cheek growing hot just thinking of it.

“I mean, Mother has seen it all. How do you think I came about?” she said. “And as far as I’m concerned, I’ve seen you naked many times, and there was that one time… when I watched you with…”

“You did what!” My face flushed with embarrassment.

“It was nothing. I was at Craeta’s place looking for you, and I heard you being loud, so I went to see,” she said, casually. “Tell me, how does it feel? The thing is absolutely massive. I would have thought it would only fit it other Beastvolk.”

“It’s bad enough that you saw me doing it, now you actually ask me questions about it,” I exclaimed. “I think I just might go to sleep.”

“Oh, come on, sister. I wanted to ask you for so long, but I never knew how. Now that I finally have, you refuse to answer me.

“Maybe I’ll have to get married to one to find out, because my sister is truly a most entitled, tight-lipped sister who refuses to educate her younger sister.”

“It… It was good. It feels pleasant, as if you aren’t being filled with a flesh, but love.”

“Oh, so romantic,” Dea said in a mocking, dreamy voice.

“Hey, you were the one who asked me the question,” I complained.

“I did. But I wanted something more… detailed, visceral. Like, how far did it go into you? Did it… hurt? Does your stomach bulge when it goes in? How did her cum fit inside you? Did your stomach grow with cum?”

“You really want to know all this stuff? You are the most curious person,” I said. “Well, actually she hasn’t really come inside of me yet. We didn’t want to since we don’t know how it’ll work between us.”

“So, I’ll see it happen for the first time. Oh, yes!”

“Why I landed with the weirdest of sisters, only Pheruksa can say!”

Everything was strangely silent for a while. Only the night’s sound, chirping of insects, the wind blowing, the sound of chimes that accompanied it.

“What do you think happens when we’ve found everyone else? They’ll surely want to leave this planet. Yuri Ayasedi was quite adamant on taking us to this new place she discovered.” Dea’s voice had grown quite serious. I looked towards her, the girl, though a woman she still looked a girl, her brown eyes were filled with a longing look.

“I’m going to stay. I love her, Dea. I would not bear to leave her home, much less the planet without her,” I answered with difficulty. “Unless Craeta wants to come with us, and Cano let’s her go. Where she goes, I go.” I felt a deep yawn come with the conviction I had.

“Sleepy now? Go to sleep. Tomorrow is a big day,” the girl said, sounding much more like the woman she was growing to be. I slid down onto the mattress while she pulled up the bedsheet.

The next day, Alto was the first to enter my room as usual. As the dresser, she charged in, carrying the set of clothes that I would be required to wear, and furiously started to strip me. Once done, she quickly bathed me with cold water and then dressed me in a simply adorned, traditional Ranthisian dress. Consisting of a blouse and skirt which worn alone would expose the midriff, the dress was then supplemented with a scarf that hung around the shoulders, the two sides gracefully falling down the front. Each cloth was covered with spiral patterns sacred to Kvilkovoa, the Goddess who was to be patron to our marriage. The number of different clothes were to be exact and unchanged for both me and Craeta.

Once she was finished, Alto made an endearing embrace with a welcome to the family before moving towards Craeta’s room. I sat there in apprehension, waiting for the call to come down to the primary ceremony. Both mother and Dea would be outside listening to the matriarch as she performed the customary steps before the marriage ritual.

“Come now,” Alto’s voice finally came. “We are ready for you.”

I walked out into the main hall where the wedding was to take place. A fire was placed

   Translator’s Note: Think of a long, colorful, and more covering apron that extends to the feet, and an extremely cropped jacket worn over it.

   Translator’s Note: Since on Zai, there are 3 sexes, there is no equivalent of men and women, especially in terms of one gender being the head of the household. While it is true that most households during the time of writing were headed by an `esiʈi`, there were still others that were headed by an `ajɛsɖɶ`, or an even rarer household headed by a `ɖiʒiɖi`. On the other hand, Athos had the traditional two gendered system which was conveniently human and organized by a dominant man and submissive female, though it was much less restrictive than the old, or even modern, human society. Thus, Ayasedi makes this distinction for her Teathuda scribe.

.. [3]
   At this moment, Ayasedi took a few more moments to describe the distinction between a man and a woman in Athos. We have removed this section.

   `ɹiʈa`

   A long skirt hung above the waist that covers the midriff.

   `eɹaʈɛ`

   `jyʋi`: the name of the collective city-state and people of Saetha, as well as her family name.

   An action of servitude in Athos, a simple bow is not enough. A servant, especially if new, must show respect by bending over completely, and walking towards the master from the start of the room to where the master has called to. The position is only released to do tasks ordered or when told to do so.

   `ʋeʃjœ`: one of the biggest city-states in Athos, and among many other things home to the most prestigious prostitute school, *The Academy Courtesan*.

   `ʋɹisa`

   :zean-like:`aɹʈʃi`: a small flying ship floating with the help of technology that we will not be discussing.

   `jyɹi` – a honorific used for someone older and wiser.

   We have obviously translated the Ranthis text for readability. In the future, we shall not include a footnote to indicate a text translated from Ranthisian. On the contrary, since this story is located in Ranthis, one should assume the change in language. Besides the thought of the main characters which are firmly rooted to their homeland, the language shall be Ranthisian from this point onwards.

.. [14]
   There is no concept of father and mother in the traditional male and female sense in Ranthis, since everyone is physically the same. This duality of this concept extends more towards dominant and submissive. Father and mother are just the closest synonym which could effectively translate from this idea.

.. [15]
   Since there isn’t a concept of gender by that time in Ranthis, the word woman closer coincided with person. Yet because of their distinctively female look, we have generalized to the word woman instead.

.. [16]
   There is a specific word in the Ranthisian language for the dominant in a relationship and submissive in a relationship that is equivalent to ‘father’ and ‘mother’ respectively. But since in marriage, there is no child, hence no ‘father’ or ‘mother,’ we have opted to translate it such.

.. [17]
   Sethi, in this sentence, is talking about a panther, which is found in Athos, and, as she correctly presumed, also in Ranthis.

.. [18]
   At this point, Sethi points out how strange the entire experience for her, i.e., the womanliness of the sound directly contrasting with the manliness of the sexual organ, as well as the animalistic nature of the purr. This she goes into great detail, again because of the nature of gender and sex in Adasi.

.. [19]
   Yes, to the surprise of many humans, the residents of Adasi do have knowledge of basic chemistry and physiology, at least of their own body. Of course, it would be surprising if they did not have knowledge of their own physiology, considering their partly artificial nature, in a technical sense.

.. [20]
   It may seem strange to human readers, why Sethi so accurately described the penis. For one, it is a custom when talking of sexual exploits to talk about such things. Moreover, keep in mind, that the unnamed overseer actually took Sethi’s virginity. Since she didn’t actually know the name of the person, so she instead accurately describes her penis.

.. [21]
   The term husband, as we have said before, refers to the person who Craeta was first gifted to or married to: Cano. We use the term sister-wives as a loose translation to mean the other wives of Cano who are “sisters” of Craeta, but not in blood relation, but as other wives of Cano.
