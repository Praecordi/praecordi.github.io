            .. dropdown:: Replacement for *The Beginning of Change*

                A scene/short story similar to the *The Beginning of Change* which shows the beginnnig of `ajɛseɖi`'s progress of loosening up and loosing her modest. Just eliminate the first section about her mother, or replace with a new section about her life before. The orientation scene is similar, except highlight `ajɛseɖi` being older than everyone. Then the rest of the scene follows as usual, except `stɹai` is also there, and she is much more excited/accepting than `ajɛseɖi`.

            .. dropdown:: Replacement for *Relief*

                This story is completely useless now. The new story will be about `saeθa`'s first moments or days at the Temple of the Primal Weaver, as she is getting introduced to the new environment. We can also see her budding relationship with `eɹaʈɛ`, maybe.

        .. grid-item::

            .. dropdown:: Replacement for *Escape*

                This also needs to change completely. The new story will be about `saiʃeʈa` rescuing `ajɛseɖi` from the Academy prison and escaping `ʋeʃjœ`. It continues through the chase by the Academy soldiers to meeting the bandits for the first time and negotiating with them.

            .. dropdown:: Idea 1

                A story on why `yʈaʃø` hates `ajɛseɖi` so much. I had an idea, but I forgot. I think it was something related to `ajɛseɖi` performing an innocent prank, or some unknowingly humiliating action against `yʈaʃø`. Whatever it is, I think `yʈaʃø`'s anger has to stem from something more than jealousy.
